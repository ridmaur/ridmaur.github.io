For example, you can add your daily updated Apple Music Heavy Rotations Mix to a collection, or the Billboard Top 100 playlist on Spotify to a collection. When adding a playlist, you can select whether you want to add the playlist to the collection and pick entries from it later, or immediately create a new chart from the playlist. A ton of additional information is now available for your chart entries. Tap on the artwork in the entry details and you will find additional information the music service (iTunes, Apple Music, or Spotify) provides. On top of that you can retrieve information from other sources like Last.fm, Discogs, Genius. If there is more artwork available (for example liner notes, etc.) for a song or an album, it is displayed in cover flow. You can tap on any artwork to see a full screen version which you can drag and zoom for more details. The app now offers integration with Last.fm. If you have configured to like/love tracks for a collection, and you actually do like/love one or more entries, these entries are also added to your  loved tracks in Last.fm. If you play an entry through the app, the entry is added to your Last.fm scrobbles. You can configure your Last.fm account in Settings. The app also integrates with the beautiful NowPlaying app; an app to explore the hidden stories behind your favourite music & enhance your listening experience. In the Statistics screen you can now search for Artist, Entry Title amongst all entries and Chart Title amongst all charts. Added some utility admin functions, for example to delete all reminders and to make a full backup in JSON of all your collections."

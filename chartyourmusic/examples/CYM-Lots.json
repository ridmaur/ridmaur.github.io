        "notes" : "“You can feel a lot of motion and energy,” Caroline Polachek tells Apple Music of her second solo studio album. “And chaos. I definitely leaned into that chaos.” Written and recorded during a pandemic and in stolen moments while Polachek toured with Dua Lipa in 2022, Desire, I Want to Turn Into You is Polachek’s self-described “maximalist” album, and it weaponises everything in her kaleidoscopic arsenal. “I set out with an interest in making a more uptempo record,” she says. “Songs like ‘Bunny Is a Rider’, ‘Welcome to My Island’ and ‘Smoke’ came onto the plate first and felt more hot-blooded and urgent than anything I’d done before. But of course, life happened, the pandemic happened, I evolved as a person, and I can’t really deny that a lunar, wistful side of my writing can never be kept out of the house. So it ended up being quite a wide constellation of songs.” Polachek cites artists including Massive Attack, SOPHIE, Donna Lewis, Enya, Madonna, The Beach Boys, Timbaland, Suzanne Vega, Ennio Morricone and Matia Bazar as inspirations, but this broad church only really hints at Desire…’s palette. Across its 12 songs we get trip-hop, bagpipes, Spanish guitars, psychedelic folk, ’60s reverb, spoken word, breakbeats, a children’s choir and actual Dido—all anchored by Polachek’s unteachable way around a hook and disregard for low-hanging pop hits. This is imperial-era Caroline Polachek. “The album’s medium is feeling,” she says. “It’s about character and movement and dynamics, while dealing with catharsis and vitality. It refuses literal interpretation on purpose.” Read on for Polachek’s track-by-track guide. “Welcome to My Island” “‘Welcome to My Island’ was the first song written on this album. And it definitely sets the tone. The opening, which is this minute-long non-lyrical wail, came out of a feeling of a frustration with the tidiness of lyrics and wanting to just express something kind of more primal and urgent. The song is also very funny. We snap right down from that Tarzan moment down to this bitchy, bratty spoken verse that really becomes the main personality of this song. It’s really about ego at its core—about being trapped in your own head and forcing everyone else in there with you, rather than capitulating or compromising. In that sense, it's both commanding and totally pathetic. The bridge addresses my father [James Polachek died in 2020 from COVID-19], who never really approved of my music. He wanted me to be making stuff that was more political, intellectual and radical. But also, at the same time, he wasn’t good at living his own life. The song establishes that there is a recognition of my own stupidity and flaws on this album, that it’s funny and also that we're not holding back at all—we’re going in at a hundred percent.” “Pretty in Possible” “If ‘Welcome to My Island’ is the insane overture, ‘Pretty in Possible’ finds me at street level, just daydreaming. I wanted to do something with as little structure as possible where you just enter a song vocally and just flow and there's no discernible verses or choruses. It’s actually a surprisingly difficult memo to stick to because it's so easy to get into these little patterns and want to bring them back. I managed to refuse the repetition of stuff—except for, of course, the opening vocals, which are a nod to Suzanne Vega, definitely. It’s my favourite song on the album, mostly because I got to be so free inside of it. It’s a very simple song, outside a beautiful string section inspired by Massive Attack’s ‘Unfinished Sympathy’. Those dark, dense strings give this song a sadness and depth that come out of nowhere. These orchestral swells at the end of songs became a compositional motif on the album.” “Bunny Is a Rider” “A spicy little summer song about being unavailable, which includes my favourite bassline of the album—this quite minimal funk bassline. Structurally on this one, I really wanted it to flow without people having a sense of the traditional dynamics between verses and choruses. Timbaland was a massive influence on that song—especially around how the beat essentially doesn't change the whole song. You just enter it and flow. ‘Bunny Is a Rider’ was a set of words that just flowed out without me thinking too much about it. And the next thing I know, we made ‘Bunny Is a Rider’ thongs. I love getting occasional Instagram tags of people in their ‘Bunny Is a Rider’ thongs. An endless source of happiness for me.” “Sunset” “This was a song I began writing with Sega Bodega in 2020. It sounded completely nothing like the others. It had a folk feel, it was gypsy Spanish, Italian, Greek feel to it. It completely made me look at the album differently—and start to see a visual world for them that was a bit more folk, but living very much in the swirl of city life, having this connection to a secret, underground level of antiquity and the universalities of art. It was written right around a month or two after Ennio Morricone passed away, so I'd been thinking a lot about this epic tone of his work, and about how sunsets are the biggest film clichés in spaghetti westerns. We were laughing about how it felt really flamenco and Spanish—not knowing that a few months later, I was going to find myself kicked out of the UK because I'd overstayed my visa without realising it, and so I moved my sessions with Sega to Barcelona. It felt like the song had been a bit of a premonition that that chapter-writing was going to happen. We ended up getting this incredible Spanish guitarist, Marc Lopez, to play the part.” “Crude Drawing of an Angel” “‘Crude Drawing of an Angel’ was born, in some ways, out of me thinking about jokingly having invented the word ‘scorny’—which is scary and horny at the same time. I have a playlist of scorny music that I'm still working on and I realised that it was a tone that I'd never actually explored. I was also reading John Berger's book on drawing [2005’s Berger on Drawing] and thinking about trace-leaving as a form of drawing, and as an extremely beautiful way of looking at sensuality. This song is set in a hotel room in which the word ‘drawing’ takes on six different meanings. It imagines watching someone wake up, not realising they're being observed, whilst drawing them, knowing that's probably the last time you're going to see them.” “I Believe” “‘I Believe’ is a real dedication to a tone. I was in Italy midway through the pandemic and heard this song called ‘Ti Sento’ by Matia Bazar at a house party that blew my mind. It was the way she was singing that blew me away—that she was pushing her voice absolutely to the limit, and underneath were these incredible key changes where every chorus would completely catch you off guard. But she would kind of propel herself right through the centre of it. And it got me thinking about the archetype of the diva vocally—about how really it's very womanly that it’s a woman's voice and not a girl's voice. That there’s a sense of authority and a sense of passion and also an acknowledgement of either your power to heal or your power to destroy. At the same time, I was processing the loss of my friend SOPHIE and was thinking about her actually as a form of diva archetype; a lot of our shared taste in music, especially ’80s music, kind of lined up with a lot of those attitudes. So I wanted to dedicate these lyrics to her.” “Fly to You” (feat. Grimes and Dido) “A very simple song at its core. It's about this sense of resolution that can come with finally seeing someone after being separated from them for a while. And when a lot of misunderstanding and distrust can seep in with that distance, the kind of miraculous feeling of clearing that murk to find that sort of miraculous resolution and clarity. And so in this song, Grimes, Dido and I kind of find our different version of that. But more so than anything literal, this song is really about beauty, I think, about all of us just leaning into this kind of euphoric, forward-flowing movement in our singing and flying over these crystalline tiny drum and bass breaks that are accompanied by these big Ibiza guitar solos and kind of Nintendo flutes, and finding this place where very detailed electronic music and very pure singing can meet in the middle. And I think it's something that, it's a kind of feeling that all of us have done different versions of in our music and now we get to together.” “Blood and Butter” “This was written as a bit of a challenge between me and Danny L Harle where we tried to contain an entire song to two chords, which of course we do fail at, but only just. It’s a pastoral, it's a psychedelic folk song. It imagines itself set in England in the summer, in June. It's also a love letter to a lot of the music I listened to growing up—these very trance-like, mantra-like songs, like Donna Lewis’ ‘I Love You Always Forever’, a lot of Madonna’s Ray of Light album, Savage Garden—that really pulsing, tantric electronic music that has a quite sweet and folksy edge to it. The solo is played by a hugely talented and brilliant bagpipe player named Brighde Chaimbeul, whose album The Reeling I'd found in 2022 and became quite obsessed with.” “Hopedrunk Everasking” “I couldn't really decide if this song needed to be about death or about being deeply, deeply in love. I then had this revelation around the idea of tunnelling, this idea of retreating into the tunnel, which I think I feel sometimes when I'm very deeply in love. The feeling of wanting to retreat from the rest of the world and block the whole rest of the world out just to be around someone and go into this place that only they and I know. And then simultaneously in my very few relationships with losing someone, I did feel some this sense of retreat, of someone going into their own body and away from the world. And the song feels so deeply primal to me. The melody and chords of it were written with Danny L Harle, ironically during the Dua Lipa tour—when I had never been in more of a pop atmosphere in my entire life.” “Butterfly Net” “‘Butterfly Net’ is maybe the most narrative storyteller moment on the whole album. And also, palette-wise, deviates from the more hybrid electronic palette that we've been in to go fully into this 1960s drum reverb band atmosphere. I'm playing an organ solo. I was listening to a lot of ’60s Italian music, and the way they use reverbs as a holder of the voice and space and very minimal arrangements to such incredible effect. It's set in three parts, which was somewhat inspired by this triptych of songs called ‘Chansons de Bilitis’ by Claude Debussy that I had learned to sing with my opera teacher. I really liked that structure of the finding someone falling in love, the deepening of it, and then the tragedy at the end. It uses the metaphor of the butterfly net to speak about the inability to keep memories, to keep love, to keep the feeling of someone's presence. The children's choir [London's Trinity Choir] we hear on ‘Billions’ comes in again—they get their beautiful feature at the end where their voices actually become the stand-in for the light of the world being onto me.” “Smoke” “It was, most importantly, the first song for the album written with a breakbeat, which inspired me to carry on down that path. It’s about catharsis. The opening line is about pretending that something isn't catastrophic when it obviously is. It's about denial. It's about pretending that the situation or your feelings for someone aren't tectonic, but of course they are. And then, of course, in the chorus, everything pours right out. But tonally it feels like I'm at home base with ‘Smoke’. It has links to songs like [2019’s] ‘Pang’, which, for me, have this windswept feeling of being quite out of control, but are also very soulful and carried by the music. We're getting a much more nocturnal, clattery, chaotic picture.” “Billions” “‘Billions’ is last for all the same reasons that 'Welcome to My Island’ is first. It dissolves into total selflessness, whereas the album opens with total selfishness. The Beach Boys’ ‘Surf’s Up’ is one of my favourite songs of all time. I cannot listen to it without sobbing. But the non-linear, spiritual, tumbling, open quality of that song was something that I wanted to bring into the song. But 'Billions' is really about pure sensuality, about all agenda falling away and just the gorgeous sensuality of existing in this world that's so full of abundance, and so full of contradictions, humour and eroticism. It’s a cheeky sailboat trip through all these feelings. You know that feeling of when you're driving a car to the beach, that first moment when you turn the corner and see the ocean spreading out in front of you? That's what I wanted the ending of this album to feel like: The song goes very quiet all of a sudden, and then you see the water and the children's choir comes in.”",

        "notes" : "At the turn of the century, Radiohead released two albums that forever altered their identity. Now, Kid A and Amnesiac are reissued as a pair, along with whatever worthy B-sides, alternate versions, and outtakes they can find.\nKid A and Amnesiac, released eight months apart, have always had a big brother\/kid brother relationship. They were recorded at the same time, during the same sessions, but Amnesiac inevitably became seen as a repository, the place where the music that wasn’t on Kid A found a home. As a standalone album, its reputation has been unsettled since the minute it was released—in a glowing New Yorker profile that same year, Alex Ross watches them tersely correct a hapless young MTV News reporter who accidentally refers to Amnesiac as the “outtakes.” “Try again,” snapped Phil Selway.\n\nThe band separated the two releases because they wanted to avoid releasing a double album, that most tired and bloated of rock-excess beasts. At the time, avoidance of all rock-star gestures had become something of a survival mechanism for the band. They had been touring, more or less continuously, for the past seven years. Six months into the long, punishing tour for OK Computer, Thom Yorke had briefly slipped into catatonia. They were getting more successful, and it felt awful: Watch the 1998 documentary Meeting People Is Easy and you’ll see what rock stardom felt like to Yorke’s nervous system—dull, pointless torture, like being detained for eternity by airport security.\n\nWhen they began the fitful, labored studio sessions that would produce both Kid A and Amnesiac in late 1999 and 2000, Radiohead knew very little about what they wanted, only that they did not want to be “rock stars” anymore. Their new music, whatever else it might be, must accomplish that singular objective: All rock-band gestures were to be isolated, rooted out, and erased. They wanted to, as the song title had it, disappear completely.\n\nA Radiohead axiom is that whatever the band set out to do, they usually wind up accomplishing the exact opposite. When they went in to record OK Computer, Thom Yorke declared confidently that they were about to make their first “positive” record. And when they released Kid A—the album meant to chart a new course away from the rock-star treadmill—it became their first-ever album to simultaneously top the U.S. and UK charts. Even more than “Creep,” which had only blown up Stateside, Kid A was now their big hit. Eight months later, Amnesiac would reach No. 2. They had gone as far away from guitar-based rock music as they knew how to go, and at the end of it, not only were Radiohead still a rock band, they were a generational one. All roads led back to the arena stage, even their escape route.\n\nIn the last five or so years, the band seems to have come to terms with its status—Selway and Ed O’Brien graciously accepted the band’s nomination into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. In 2017, they entered their commemorative re-release phase with OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017, which collected the band’s foundational third album along with its ephemera. Now, they have finally released that long-avoided double album: Kid A Mnesia, which unites the two studio albums, along with whatever worthy B-sides, alternate versions, and outtakes they can find. \n\nLike many of their recent gestures—putting their music on Spotify for fans, years after Yorke memorably dubbed the streaming service “the last desperate fart” in the music industry’s “dying corpse”; releasing hours of their demos for OK Computer after someone hacked their MiniDiscs from the sessions—it feels like an act of both generosity and capitulation. They have long since stopped fighting, but these albums capture the band when the stakes felt mortal; in recording these albums, they were fighting for their lives.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, the band was frequently aimless, frustrated, certain only that they were accomplishing very little. On the online journal he maintained on Radiohead’s website during the recording sessions, O’Brien worried publicly that the band was steering itself toward oblivion. “It’s taken us seven years to get this sort of freedom, and it’s what we always wanted,” he wrote. “But it could be so easy to fuck it all up.” At times, it seems like every one of them was casting about in different directions, returning with half-cooked pieces of music that nobody else quite knew what to do with. They didn’t know what kind of band they were supposed to become, but they all knew they were tired of the band they were currently in. None of them had one clear, resounding idea for a new direction.\n\nOne of the earliest songs they struggled with was “In Limbo,” which layers guitar triplets over straight 4\/4 drums, both of which slid off the surface of the underlying 6\/4 meter. Rhythmically, it created a featureless expanse with no distinguishing marks, and the song’s pulse resembled ocean waves more than any sort of backbeat. Perhaps in a nod to the song’s maze-like rhythm, perhaps in acknowledgment of the quicksand they felt underneath, they called the demo “Lost at Sea.”\n\nMeanwhile, Jonny Greenwood was fooling around with modular synthesizers, playing patches of radio static and snatches of electronic music records over rudimentary drum machine patterns, searching for a moment of inspiration. Yorke listened to it patiently, and found only 40 seconds of usable material—four refracted synth chords from the American composer Paul Lansky’s computer piece “Mild Un Liese.” The seeds of “Idioteque” were planted.\n\nIn all this seeming directionlessness, Radiohead were zeroing in on the most primal essence of their art—sound. Critics at the time knocked Kid A and Amnesiac for seeming half-formed, or sketch-like, but the de-emphasis on things like bridges and middle-eights seemed strategic. The members were seeking textures and tones, spaces expansive and inviting enough that they might stay awhile. In doing so, they reinvented the timbral palette for a rock band.\n\nIt was on Kid A and Amnesiac that they became in love with almost recognizable sounds. What was born out of a desire to erase—and Yorke used this word more than once, suggesting a vigorous desire, naming his solo album after this impulse—became an opportunity to transfigure. The standard rock instruments became the ghosts—nothing in Kid A sounds so otherworldly as the guitars, or Yorke’s voice. On “Morning Bell,” Greenwood scraped the strings with a coin to produce keyboard-like sounds.\n\nThe disembodied guitar sounds mingled eerily with the ondes Martenot, an instrument Jonny Greenwood mastered after becoming obsessed with the music of French composer Olivier Messiaen. Messiaen employed the ondes Martenot in his celebrated large-scale 1948 work Turangalîla-Symphonie, which generated ecstatic, alien textures from the full orchestra and the early electronic instrument’s disembodied whine. The ondes Martenot is everywhere on these two albums—whining alongside the string section in “How to Disappear Completely,” doubling the guitar and vocals on “Optimistic.” It is deployed as a forbidding chill whenever the textures threaten to get too familiar. Likewise, it’s the non-rock instruments that are allowed to breathe, to exist in a recognizable shape as themselves—a harp glissandi, for instance, or a harmonium, both on “Motion Picture Soundtrack,” or the wailing New Orleans brass band on “Life in a Glass House.” These are the warmest textures on albums that defined digital-age paranoia, and they predate electricity completely.\n\nKid A was the first Radiohead album released in the harsh light of the Napster era, the dawn of music’s digital age. Because of that, the songs that would come to comprise Amnesiac were already pretty familiar to Radiohead fans who had been trolling P2P servers for new material. Live and demo versions of “Dollars and Cents,” “You and Whose Army?” and “Pyramid Song” were freely traded over Napster, as were a few of the outtakes that didn’t make either album.\n\nThis means that none of the bonus material on Kid Amnesiae, the third “bonus” disc accompanying the two studio albums, has the same revelatory quality as the inclusions on OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017. The tracklist is padded out slightly with the isolated string tracks for “Pyramid Song” and “How to Disappear Completely,” as well as a murmured two-minute take on “Morning Bell” that sounds like a rehearsal for the version that appeared on Amnesiac. There is no “I Promise,” no “Lift,” no bolt-from-the-blue alternate history that redefines our understanding of the band that wrote the album material. “Follow Me Around,” which was billed as the big inclusion on this re-release and the “holy grail” for Radiohead fans, is a song that most Radiohead hardcore faithful know extremely well—it was included in a pivotal scene of Meeting People Is Easy.\n\nAnother “lost” Radiohead song from these sessions, “Fog,” is a little more intriguing. It was one of those nakedly vulnerable ballads that slipped out of Yorke from time to time, seemingly against his will. The grief-haunted lyrics mingled tenderness and dread—a child, possibly dead, runs forever up and down a hallway, while a luminous fog belches up from the sewers.\n\nThey first premiered it at a concert in Israel, where it was known as “Alligators in New York Sewers,” in July 2000. The live version is a simple, arresting two-minute piano ballad. The original studio version, which found its way into the world as one of the B-sides to the “Knives Out” single, preserved this intimacy, but was marred by a slightly out-of-time tambourine and an uncertain-sounding guitar part. The version they include here isn’t as good as either, with overly bright synth patches and a non-committal vocal take. It underscores the trouble that Radiohead have often had with their tender songs. If there is anything comical about the band, it is their distrust of their own instincts to write beautiful songs, and the agony and prolonged discomfort it seems to provoke in them.\n\nIf not for this slightly adolescent distrust of prettiness, however, Kid A might never have been born. “It annoys me how pretty my voice is,” Yorke famously griped, and the last 20 years of their music can sometimes be seen as a battle between Yorke’s uglier impulses squaring off against the choirboy lilt of the instrument he’s stuck with.\n\nYorke’s impulse to deform himself on record, however, led to moments of wild creativity. On Amnesiac’s “Pulk\/Pull Revolving Doors,” seven years before Lil Wayne’s “Lollipop,” he intentionally mangled his voice with Auto-Tune. As an entire generation of hip-hop performers would go on to do, Yorke mumbled into the machine, allowing the pitch-corrector to randomly assign a key and a melody to his words.\n\nPerhaps no single song encapsulates this mix of aimlessness and invention, the will toward prettiness and the losing war against it, as neatly as “Like Spinning Plates.” In the studio, they were grimacing their way through another demo—the chord progressions were somehow insulting, too obvious. Thom Yorke, always quick with a withering aside for their own material, dubbed it “dodgy Kraftwerk.”\n\nThey couldn’t stop messing with it, however. No idea the band generated, no matter how wispy or maddeningly incomplete, seemed to stay away forever. (Yorke apparently wrote the bassline for “The National Anthem” when he was 16, and it sounds like it.) Their song fragments were like sick dogs that wouldn’t stop limping after their masters. So there was Greenwood, messing around with the latest playback of that pretty ballad. Out of boredom, a fit of pique, whatever, he played it backwards.\n\nYorke, who was nearby, was transfixed. He crossed the room and demanded to hear it again. The track, played backwards, sounded like it was sucking nearby debris inward and pulling everything down with it. Yorke sat down and wrote a new song on top of his upside-down old one. But the backwards\/forwards vortex seemed to have inspired a fever. So he sang his own lyrics backwards, on purpose, live. Then he reversed them so we heard them forwards—a subliminal message, just like the hysterical censors told us there would be when we played our records backward. But there it was, floating on the surface like a plastic bottle on the ocean.\n\nThat original upside-down song was a pretty ballad called “I Will,” which they would go on to rework, yet another time, and release for 2003’s Hail to the Thief. Radiohead fans have long tried to sync up the two versions themselves, re-reversing “Like Spinning Plates” and laying the vocal take from “I Will” atop it to recreate that “dodgy Kraftwerk” demo that is lost to history.\n\nKid Amnesiae does not include that original “I Will” demo, which, given the juvenilia and ephemera the band has allowed to see the light of day by now, suggests just how much Yorke must still hate it. The “Like Spinning Plates” version on the bonus disc layers the grand piano arpeggios familiar from the version on I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings atop the backmasked effects of the studio version. Notably, Yorke adds a verse that brings his desire for escape at the time into urgent focus: “Why us? Why not someone else?\/The cameras are turning off.” Like Bob Dylan post-motorcycle crash, doing everything he could to discourage the press and his fan’s interest only to increase his enigmatic appeal, Yorke struggled against the straitjacket of his band’s grandness only to feel it pull tighter.\n\nDecades later, the grandness of those sounds is what lingers. This is Radiohead’s ultimate gift as a rock band—the transmutation of sound into sensation, the way an unnerving bit of audio can play upon our nerve endings, up-end us ever so slightly. The searching language of the chorus to “Like Spinning Plates” (“This just feels like…Spinning plates”) nailed the curious, uneasy feeling that sound can give us, and the way those feelings translate into our other senses. It was the indelible sounds they made on Kid A and Amnesiac, more than any of the album’s digital age paranoia or its baleful view of the future, that comprise the band’s enduring legacy. Those sounds break free of anything you might want to attach to them.",

        "notes" : "It has nearly become a cliché unto itself for so many albums released in 2021 and 2022: an accomplished work of art that perfectly articulates themes of isolation and desperation and fatalism, only for the artists to reveal that the songs that express these ideas most acutely were written before the pandemic. “It was already sort of all in the world,” Arcade Fire’s Win Butler tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “In order to write music, you have to have this antenna up that kind of picks up little signals from the future and signals from the past. And so I think a lot of times we're just getting these like aftershocks of things that are about to happen.” WE is 10 tracks, but really more like five songs, taking into account various parts and chapters that give the album its epic scope, capturing the joy-in-the-face-of-peril spirit of their beloved 2004 debut Funeral, only with the peril a bit heightened. The songs that Butler and his wife Régine Chassagne started in their backyard New Orleans studio prior to March 2020 form a narrative that opens in a state of despair and winds up in an unlikely place of hope and optimism, with all the exuberance that marks the band’s most memorable songs. Like all Arcade Fire albums, WE is a family affair, featuring not just Butler, Chassagne and Butler’s younger brother Will—who has since left the group, amicably—but Butler’s mom, a harpist, as well as guest vocals from Peter Gabriel. Read on as Butler expounds on a few key moments from WE. “End of the Empire I-III” “It's easy to interpret everything as being about the present, and I think there's an element of that, but I think you're trying to pick up on smoke signals. To me, the end of the empire isn't about now, it's about the future. It's about what's coming. I'm still waiting to wake up and check my phone and see the stock market has finally crashed. I mean, it's just an inevitability. This stuff is so cyclical, and it's like we're just printing money and pretending everything's okay. My grandfather lived through the Depression and was a musician in World War II and lived through some pretty intense stuff, and so I think this generation is up to the task as well. We have an eight-year-old, and the tools that he has compared to the tools that I had at that age are incredible.” “End of the Empire IV (Sagittarius A)” “‘End of the Empire’ is four parts; we had the first three parts and it was already six and a half minutes. For some reason I just knew that there was a fourth part to it, and I had this index card that said, ‘Sagittarius A’, which is a black hole in the middle of our solar system. I just had the card on my wall and I would just walk by it. As soon as I was vaccinated and was able to travel, I went with my son to go visit my parents because I hadn't seen them in a long time. I went back to their house in Maine and I brought my 4-track and I put it in the basement of their house and ran a bunch of cables up to the top floor. I felt like I was 15. It was exactly like the shit I was doing when I was 15. I was like, 'Mom, I'm working on this song.' We would play 'Sagittarius A' together. There were a couple other songs that I did these 4-track recordings of playing it with her, and it sort of helped me to work through it and to just figure out what it is.” “The Lightning II” “What was in my head when I was singing that song was all the Haitians at the border trying to get into the US who had taken a boat from Haiti to Brazil and then walked or taken a train all the way to the Mexican border. Just to find a better life for your family—imagine what it would take, the bravery. The governor of Texas can honestly...I don't hate a lot of people, but I hate that motherfucker. I don't even believe in hell, but if there's a hell, that motherfucker's going there. Just to meet people with the absolute absence of compassion, these fake fucking Christians. That's not necessarily what the song's about, but that was what was in my head: What does it mean to not quit and to reach the end and then to be turned back, and you still can't quit because you still have your family, so then you get sent back to where you started and you still can't give up because it's still your life and it's still your family and you're still fighting for survival.” “Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)” “I was really just thinking about my son and the world that he's facing and how I was a very depressed kid, particularly in high school. I was trying to imagine the way that I'm wired, just chemically, having to deal with that now, not to mention 10 years from now, whenever the fuck he's going to be dealing with it. He's going to need to have a thick skin and to just really be able to take a hit and have some fortitude. And basically just the idea of unconditional love, which is this impossible thing to achieve. But we do it naturally, somehow. And it's something that I think we naturally have with our kids, but I think it's something that we're supposed to have for people that we're not related to as well.” “WE” “I think the journey of the record, the first half is: Imagine this character's like, 'Get me the F out of here, get me off this planet, get me out of my own skin, get me away from myself. I don't want to be here.' It's anxiety and it's depression and it's heaviness, it's the weight of the world. And he looks at this black hole like, 'Well, maybe if I could get through that black hole, that would be far enough away.' And when he gets there, he finds that it's himself and it's everyone he ever loved and the lives of his ancestors. There's nothing to escape, because it's all the same thing anyway. Stories and films are always building towards this big conclusion and then the credits roll. And to me, the sentiment is, 'Let's just fucking do it again, with all of it—all the pain, all the loneliness, all the sadness, all the heartbreak. I just want to do it over and over again. Just run it back.”",

        "notes" : "“This album is all about contrasts,” Weval’s Harm Coolen tells Apple Music. “It’s mixing in-your-face, heavy dance music with a joyful hopefulness to make you move.” Since forming in 2012, Dutch duo Harm Coolen and Merijn Scholte Albers have been crafting melodically intricate electronic tracks with an underlying acoustic warmth. Theirs is a sound full of earworming melodies and luscious arrangements, producing 2016’s self-titled debut album and The Weight in 2019. On their latest release, Remember, they pay homage to their decade in music by piecing together fragments of long-standing unreleased songs with fresh, emphatic production. The result is 11 infectiously energetic tracks, from the soaring vocal hooks of “Never Stay for Love” to the earthy funk of “Everything Went Well” and the distorted rhythms of “Losing Days”. “It’s a propulsive record but one with a positive feeling,” Coolen says. “It’s made from the longing to play loud and to let people have fun with the music.” Read on for Coolen and Albers’ in-depth thoughts on the album, track by track. “Remember” Harm Coolen: “‘Remember’ is one of the final tracks we made for the record. We had been working on the album for three and a half years already but we were still searching for new ideas to help round out its contrasts.” Merijn Scholte Albers: “We were on the road in LA and stopped into the studio to jam with our friend, producer Daniel Lynas. It was meant to just be a hang but then we came up with the stems for ‘Remember’. It had a perfect, positive feeling and, once we got back home, we built the vocal line and knew it would be the ideal opener.” “Everything Went Well” HC: “Over the summer, we spent a week in Germany with a group of other artist friends—this was one of the tracks we wrote there. I’d just gotten back from a one-off therapy session using psychedelics, and I had an amazing experience. It’s not something I usually do but the lyrics were influenced by that unique moment, since the first sentences that came out of my mouth were about how you feel when everything goes well. It’s an uplifting song about looking back with gratitude.” “Losing Days” MSA: “This was one of the first tracks we wrote for the album, encapsulating that feeling of the two worlds of distortion and hopeful melodies combining. The beat is really heavy, like it might blow up your speakers, but the chords are so soothing.” HC: “This track started the whole concept of the record. It’s meant to be played with the volume loud and blazing.” “Where It All Leads” HC: “We had the elements of the track that would go on to become ‘Where It All Leads’ for quite some time but we didn’t know how to fully piece it together. We didn’t want to overload it, so we focused on the groove and its harshness, which gave new context to the sweet vocal lines on top.” MSA: “This has a similar concept to ‘Losing Days’, starting with a heavy beat and a compressed, gritty sound then layering on a hopeful melody.” “Don’t Lose Time” MSA: “The final 20 seconds of ‘Don’t Lose Time’ is a snippet of the first demo we made of the track. That used to be a five-minute song that we were very happy with, but it didn’t quite fit with the sound of the new record.” HC: “It was almost too sentimental, so we shifted it into a rave direction and really embraced our dance music influences. We knew we had gotten it right because we just wanted to dance in the studio when we came up with it!” “Never Stay for Love” (feat. Eefje de Visser) HC: “Eefje was one of the artists staying in the house we rented in Germany, and we asked her to feature on another tune, ‘Is That How You Feel It’. We jammed for a while over that instrumental, and she did an incredible job. So much so that when we isolated the vocal track and worked on it further, it became an entirely new song, which is ‘Never Stay for Love’.” MSA: “That reworking is something we do quite often now. It’s a fun way to surprise yourself by switching vocals from different chord progressions.” “Day After Day” MSA: “This is another fragment of an old idea—a song called ‘Days’ from 2016. We had tried to finish it for years but we always failed. We loved the basic idea but didn’t know how to fill in the other elements until I pitched the chords down one day and it became an entirely new thing. It has this driving, big-beat feel, which is exactly how we wanted the whole record to be. The song is like a train, it just keeps on going.” “Changed for the Better” HC: “‘Changed for the Better’ came out of our longing to play live again during the pandemic. We wanted to make a tune that we could play in front of a crowd once things reopened, something where the vocals are clear and punchy and that incorporates dance elements to get people moving.” MSA: “It was the perfect single for us to release as it embodies the new direction we’re exploring. It’s in-your-face, fun and full of distorted 808 kick drums.” “I Saw You” HC: “This was another late addition to the album. Since so many of the other tracks are driving and more intense, we needed a breather and something to showcase a more uplifting side to the darker elements. Even though ‘I Saw You’ is upbeat and almost drum ’n’ bass tempo, it embodies that lightness we were looking for in its melodies.” “Is That How You Feel It” HC: “Eefje’s initial vocal take for this track ended up becoming the basis for ‘Never Stay for Love’, so we were then left with a gap where we needed new lyrics and vocals. I was playing around and recording some lines and ended up slowing down the track while jamming. It suddenly made my vocal take on a great vibrato and soulful feel. It’s not our typical sound but it just fits perfectly here.” “Forever” HC: “‘Forever’ is another example of us stitching together pieces of old tracks to make something new. The beat on the song is around three years old, while the vocal was taken from another demo. We added a rave-y, acid synth line to a 120 BPM dancey feel and hopeful lyrics on being thankful for everything that has come before. As soon as we made it, we knew it was the only way to end the album.”",

        "notes" : "Mike Hadreas’ music as Perfume Genius has always walked an interesting line between experimentalism and accessibility—pop for listeners more interested in “pop” as a concept than a reality. Written as a companion to a dance piece by choreographer Kate Wallich, Ugly Season effectively inverts the balance, situating Hadreas’ hallmarks—his romanticism, his expressivity, his startling, sometimes violent sense of drama—in the context of something that plays more like a symphony or soundtrack than a set of discrete songs. The title is a feint, of course: This is extremely beautiful music even in its dissonance, from the Philip Glass-like grid of “Teeth” and the spiderweb instrumental of “Scherzo” to the industrial roar of “Hellbent”. And just in case, he gives you something called “Pop Song”—which isn’t one, of course.",

        "artist" : "Taylor Swift",
        "id" : "1650859878",
        "notes" : "Let‘s start with that speech. In September 2022, as Taylor Swift accepted Songwriter-Artist of the Decade honours at the Nashville Songwriter Awards, the headline was that Swift had unveiled an admittedly “dorky” system she’d developed for organising her own songs. Quill Pen, Fountain Pen, Glitter Gel Pen: three categories of lyrics, three imagined tools with which she wrote them, one pretty ingenious way to invite obsessive fans to lovingly obsess all the more. And yet, perhaps the real takeaway was the manner in which she spoke about her craft that night, some 20 years after writing her first song at the age of 12. “I love doing this thing we are fortunate enough to call a job,” she said to a room of her peers. “Writing songs is my life’s work and my hobby and my never-ending thrill. A song can defy logic or time. A good song transports you to your truest feelings and translates those feelings for you. A good song stays with you even when people or feelings don’t.” On Midnights, her tenth LP and fourth in as many years—if you don’t count the two she’s just re-recorded and buttressed with dozens of additional tracks—Swift sounds like she’s really enjoying her work, playing with language like kids do with gum, thrilling to the texture of every turn of phrase, the charge in every melody and satisfying rhyme. Alongside long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff, she’s set out here to tell “the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout [her] life”, as she phrased it in a message to Apple Music subscribers. It’s a concept that naturally calls for a nocturnal palette: slower tempos, hushed atmosphere, negative space like night sky. The sound is fully modern (synths you’d want to eat or sleep in, low end that sits comfortably on your chest), while the aesthetic (soft focus, wood panelling, tracklist on the cover) is decidedly mid-century, much like the Mad Men-inspired title of its brooding opener, “Lavender Haze”—a song about finding refuge in the glow of intimacy. “Talk your talk and go viral,” she sings, in reference to the maelstrom of outside interest in her six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn. “I just want this love spiral.” (A big shout to Antonoff for those spongy backup vocals, btw.) In large part, Midnights is a record of interiors, Swift letting us glimpse the chaos inside her head (“Anti-Hero”, wall-to-wall zingers) and the stillness of her relationship (“Sweet Nothing”, co-written by Alwyn under his William Bowery pseudonym). For “Snow on the Beach”, she teams up with Lana Del Rey—an artist whose instinct for mood and theatrical framing seems to have influenced Swift’s recent catalogue—recalling the magic of an impossible night over a backdrop of pizzicato violin, sleigh bells and dreamy Mellotron, like the earliest hours of Christmas morning. “I’ve never seen someone lit from within,” Swift sings. “Blurring out my periphery.” But then there’s “Bejeweled”, a late, 1989-like highlight on which she announces to an unappreciative partner, a few seconds in: “And by the way, I’m going out tonight.” And then out Swift goes, striding through the centre of the song like she would the room: “I can still make the whole place shimmer,” she sings, relishing that last word. “And when I meet the band, they ask, ‘Do you have a man?’\/I could still say, ‘I don’t remember.’” There are traces of melancholy layered in (see: “sapphire tears on my face”), but the song feels like a triumph, the sort of unabashed, extroverted fun that would have probably seemed out of place in the lockdown indie of 2020’s folklore and evermore. But here, side by side with songs and scenes of such writerly indulgence, it’s right at home—more proof that the terms “singer-songwriter” and “universal pop star” aren’t mutually exclusive ideas. “What’s a girl gonna do?” Swift asks at its climax. “A diamond’s gotta shine.” This special expanded version of Midnights includes seven additional songs.",

        "notes" : "The album of our Denia holiday trip in April 2022. \n\n“I literally don’t take breaks,” ROSALÍA tells Apple Music. “I feel like, to work at a certain level, to get a certain result, you really need to sacrifice.” Judging by MOTOMAMI, her long-anticipated follow-up to 2018’s award-winning and critically acclaimed EL MAL QUERER, the mononymous Spanish singer clearly put in the work. “I almost feel like I disappear because I needed to,” she says of maintaining her process in the face of increased popularity and attention. “I needed to focus and put all my energy and get to the centre to create.” At the same time, she found herself drawing energy from bustling locales like Los Angeles, Miami and New York, all of which she credits with influencing the new album.\n \nBeyond any particular source of inspiration that may have driven the creation of MOTOMAMI, ROSALÍA’s come-up has been nothing short of inspiring. Her transition from critically acclaimed flamenco upstart to internationally renowned star—marked by creative collaborations with global tastemakers like Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish and Oneohtrix Point Never, to name a few—has prompted an artistic metamorphosis. Her ability to navigate and dominate such a wide array of musical styles only raised expectations for her third full-length, but she resisted the idea of rushing things. “I didn’t want to make an album just because now it’s time to make an album,” she says, citing that several months were spent on mixing and visuals alone. “I don’t work like that”.\n \nSome three years after EL MAL QUERER, ROSALÍA’s return feels even more revolutionary than that radical breakout release. From the noisy-yet-referential leftfield reggaetón of “SAOKO” to the austere and Yeezus-reminiscent thump of “CHICKEN TERIYAKI”, MOTOMAMI makes the artist’s femme-forward modus operandi all the more clear. The point of view presented is sharp and political, but also permissive of playfulness and wit, a humanising mix that makes the album her most personal yet. “I was like, I really want to find a way to allow my sense of humour to be present,” she says. “It’s almost like you try to do, like, a self-portrait of a moment of who you are, how you feel, the way you think.\"\n \nThings get deeper and more unexpected with the devilish-yet-austere electronic punk funk of the title track and the feverish “BIZCOCHITO”. But there are even more twists and turns within, like “HENTAI”, a bilingual torch song that charms and enraptures before giving way to machine-gun percussion. Add to that “LA FAMA”, her mystifying team-up with The Weeknd that fuses tropical Latin rhythms with avant-garde minimalism, and you end up with one of the most unique artistic statements of the decade so far.",

There’s a gnarly guitar solo that she’s become known for at her many award-show performances, references to eating in fine-dining establishments in Paris, and a pretty piano outro. Back of My Mind never hits the triumphant high of its opener again.” \nCouldn’t agree more.

Their sessions for the 2021 album Monument were productive enough to have generated this compelling follow-up EP. Of the four contrasting songs, the title track is the most rhythmically intense, with long manipulated soprano sax sounds floating over Bellamy’s fast broken-beat patterns. On the opening “Captured Time”, Wyllie gets an almost trumpetlike tone from the soprano as string textures and rhythmic agitation swell around him. “Procession” begins in a piano-centred stillness, with breath elements and drones setting up a doleful, slowly pulsing elegy on tenor sax. “Youth”, also with Wyllie on tenor, has fat, sustaining synth-bass tones undergirding a reverberant and impassioned melody. Aesthetically, Next Stop is one with Monument, though it expands the scope of that previous achievement.",

        "notes" : "In 2017, Ctrl—a 14-track project rife with songs about love, sex, self-doubt and heartbreak—became one of the most influential albums in R&B. Ctrl was the soundtrack for many people in their twenties, highlighting the growing pains of young adulthood. SZA’s vulnerability and raw honesty, coupled with ultra-relatable lyrics full of diary-like ruminations and conversations from friend group chats, are what made her debut so impactful. Where Ctrl reflected SZA’s journey towards finding self-love and acceptance, her long-awaited sophomore LP SOS finds the St. Louis-born singer-songwriter dealing with some of the same topics of love and relationships from a more self-assured place. She ditches the uncertainties of her romantic entanglements to save herself—most of the time. On the soulful and gritty album opener “SOS”, SZA reintroduces herself and says precisely what’s on her mind after a night of crying over a lost relationship: “I talk bullshit a lot\/No more fuck shit, I’m done,” she swaggers. This isn’t the only song that shows her weariness towards relationships that no longer serve her; see also “Smoking on My Ex Pack” and “Far”. She finds the confidence to know that she doesn’t need to depend on a man to find happiness on “Conceited” and “Forgiveless”. However, not every song on the project is about moving on and leaving her past relationships behind her; SZA still has a penchant for making wrong decisions that may not end well for her (“Too Late”, “F2F”) and questions her worth in some instances (“Special”). The album sketches the ebbs and flows of emotions, with strength in one moment but deep regret and sadness the next. There’s growth between her debut and sophomore album, not just lyrically but sonically as well, blending a mix of her beloved lo-fi beats and sharing space with grunge- and punk-inspired songs without any of it sounding out of place. On the Phoebe Bridgers collaboration “Ghost in the Machine”, the duo take a deeper look at the realities of stardom, looking for a bit of humanity within their day-to-day interactions. The track is not only progressive in its use of strings and acoustic guitars but haunting in its vocal performance. Throughout the journey of SOS, there are moments of clarity and tenderness where SZA goes through the discomfort of healing while trying to find the deeper meaning within the trials and tribulations she endures. She embraces this new level of confidence in her life, where she isn’t looking for anyone to save her from the depth of her emotions but instead is at peace with where she’s at in life.",

        "notes" : "Part of the appeal of Londoner Tom Skinner’s first release under his own name is that it sounds perpetually familiar but can’t be traced to a single source. Over the course of 27 minutes and with the unusual quintet of drums, bass, two cellos and two saxophones, he compresses ’70s-style cosmic jazz (“Bishara”), noir soundtrack music (“Red 2”), abstract blues (“The Day After Tomorrow”) and sparkling post-bop (“Quiet As It’s Kept”) into pieces small enough to digest easily but dense enough to get across the essence of their respective reference points—a feat not just of composition but editing, which, in Skinner’s own words, owed more to the chopping and looping of disco and house DJs than anything else. But to the modern jazz fans who landed here because of Skinner’s affiliation with Sons of Kemet or the International Anthem label, know that Voices of Bishara isn’t a beat tape or collage project, and to the Radiohead fans curious about Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood’s collaborator in The Smile, know that, like great Radiohead, what makes Skinner’s process here interesting is how little you can hear its seams.",

        "notes" : "The nearly six-year period Kelela Mizanekristos took between 2017’s Take Me Apart and 2023’s Raven wasn’t just a break; it was a reckoning. Like a lot of Black Americans, she’d watched the protests following George Floyd’s murder with outrage and cautious curiosity as to whether the winds of social change might actually shift. She read, she watched, she researched; she digested the pressures of creative perfectionism and tireless productivity not as correlatives of an artistic mind but of capitalism and white supremacy, whose consecration of the risk-free bottom line suddenly felt like the arbitrary and invasive force it is. And suddenly, she realised she wasn’t alone. “Internally, I’ve always wished the world would change around me,” Kelela tells Apple Music. “I felt during the uprising and the [protests of the early 2020s] that there’s been an external shift. We all have more permission to say, ‘I don’t like that.’” Executive-produced by longtime collaborator Asmara (Asma Maroof of Nguzunguzu), 2023’s Raven is both an extension of her earlier work and an expansion of it. The hybrids of progressive dance and ’90s-style R&B that made Take Me Apart and Cut 4 Me compelling are still there (“Contact”, “Missed Call”, both co-produced by LSDXOXO and Bambii), as is her gift for making the ethereal feel embodied and deeply physical (“Enough for Love”). And for all her respect for the modalities of Black American pop music, you can hear the musical curiosity and experiential outliers—as someone who grew up singing jazz standards and played in a punk band—that led her to stretch the paradigms of it, too. But the album’s heart lies in songs like “Holier” and “Raven”, whose narratives of redemption and self-sufficiency jump the track from personal reflections to metaphors for the struggle with patriarchy and racism more broadly. “I’ve been pretty comfortable to talk about the nitty-gritty of relationships,” she says. “But this album contains a few songs that are overtly political, that feel more literally like no, you will not.” Oppression comes in many forms, but they all work the same way; Raven imagines a flight out.",

        "notes" : "“When it’s just us two, it’s really easy to make music,” JD BECK tells Apple Music. “We play around, and the tracks come pouring out.” Instrumental prodigies DOMi & JD BECK certainly have a telepathic connection when it comes to creativity. First meeting in 2018 at the NAMM trade show in Southern California, where the two teenagers were individually invited to perform as part of a larger ensemble, Texas-born drummer BECK formed an instant connection with French keyboardist and Berklee student DOMi Louna (born Domitille Degalle). The pair soon began writing fast-paced, note-packed jams to upload to their Instagram, and by 2020, they had caught the attention of multi-instrumentalist Anderson .Paak. Swiftly signing them to his APESHIT label, he challenged the duo to release an updated body of work as a debut. “He basically told us we could do better than the album’s worth of material we already had,” BECK says. “So, we put together a wish list of collaborators and got to work.” The result is NOT TiGHT, a 15-track jazz-fusion odyssey of head-nodding hip-hop, psychedelic vocoder experiments and rhythmic freakouts. “We just wanted to surprise ourselves with this album,” DOMi says. “This music is an expression of ourselves at our core.” Here, DOMi & JD BECK offer their thoughts on each of the album’s tracks. “LOUNA’S iNTRO” DOMi Louna: “We thought the album needed book-ending to help bring the listener in and then back out of the tracks. We already had the outro, “THANK U”, so we wrote these chords and added synth patches before sending it to violin, double bass, viola, cello and harp players all around the world. It was like a mini online orchestra opening the album for us.” “WHATUP” DL: “We’ve had these chords since 2018, as they were part of a track that was going to be the intro for our original album. We kept playing around with it when we were locked down together during the pandemic, and after deconstructing it a few times, we decided to make a new tune. We added a drum solo section, and so now the record has two intros before we get into ‘SMiLE’.” “SMiLE” JD BECK: “I sing dumb little melodies a lot, and when I was in the bathroom on my phone one day in 2018, the melody just came to me. I put it together in my head and shouted to DOMi to quickly set it to some chords.” “BOWLiNG” (feat. Thundercat) JDB: “We met Thundercat around the same time as meeting each other. Whenever we were in LA, we would go and stay with him and take over his house. We always write a lot with him when we’re there—we must have 50 song ideas together already. Back in 2018, we’d all go bowling a lot, as it’s his favourite thing to do, and so we wrote this song about hanging out in the bowling alley.” “NOT TiGHT” (feat. Thundercat) JDB: “It’s probably the closest representation of our sound—just singing random melodic lines to crazy chord combinations. In 2019, we played it for Thundercat, and he loved it so much that he wanted to be on it. He became the first instrumentalist to collaborate with us, and it was incredible to have him soloing on the track with DOMi.” “TWO SHRiMPS” (feat. Mac DeMarco) DL: “We wrote the instrumental for this track while we were on tour in 2019. JD had a little drum machine, which he made a loop on, and then I added the keyboard parts and put it in a 9\/8 time signature. We met Mac the same day we met Anderson .Paak in 2019, and by 2020, we were spending a lot of time at Mac’s house. We played him this instrumental, and he started singing along to it, just listing random sandwich names. The track was originally called ‘Sandwiches of America’. We ended up re-recording new lyrics with him, but thankfully it’s still food-related.” “U DON’T HAVE TO ROB ME” JDB: “I’ve been playing gigs by myself since I was 11, and I got used to the element of danger, being in cities late at night. When DOMi and I started going out in LA, you could feel when there was danger, like one day we were in the parking lot of the bowling alley at 1 am, and this dude asked us for a cigarette, and it really felt like he might pull a knife on us too. It made us think about how we never have cash—only cards that we can cancel easily—so why even go through that trouble of robbing us?” “MOON” (feat. Herbie Hancock) JDB: “Andy made us write down all our goals for the record, and among them was a list of people we’d love to work with. Herbie was at the top of those names. One of Andy’s managers had a connect with Herbie, and he called us one day to say that Herbie had watched our videos on YouTube and was down to collaborate.” DL: “We were shitting our pants, as we knew we now had to come up with the best song we’d ever written. Sunlight is some of our favourite stuff that Herbie has done with the vocoder, and so we wrote ‘MOON’ to that same vibe. Luckily, we got him on piano, too, and when we recorded it together in 2021, we got to hang out with him, which was amazing.” “DUKE” JDB: “This track is a George Duke reference. We had been hanging out a lot with Earl Sweatshirt and his producer Black Noise, and they inspired us to put three of our loops together into one track and then record it as a new song. The record is full of crazy songs, and we needed something to chill after Herbie—a track that has a natural feel.” “TAKE A CHANCE” (feat. Anderson .Paak) DL: “We really wanted a feature from Anderson, as we’re huge fans of his, and so we had to come up with something unique and very pretty for him to sing and play on. JD wrote this hook, and when we played it to Andy, he just started rapping over the verses, and then we all sang on the chorus. The whole track was a bunch of surprises and sections put together, since Andy can fit over pretty much anything.” “SPACE MOUNTAiN” JDB: “When we first got to LA, I couldn’t get into any clubs, so the only thing we ended up doing, apart from making music, was going to Disneyland. We went on the ride Space Mountain a lot, and it felt like the perfect title for this crazy tune. The first section is a loop we wrote in 2019, where I recorded the drums through an intense compressor, and then the second half used to be part of the original intro to our first album.” “PiLOT” (feat. Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes & Snoop Dogg) DL: “We made this beat in 2020, before we signed with Anderson. We used to send him clips of what we were making, and the day after we sent him this, he emailed it back with him and Busta on it, which was amazing. Once we signed, we had Snoop Dogg on our dream list of collabs, and we thought he would be perfect for ‘PiLOT’. He was down for it, so we went to Snoop’s studio for six hours one day and recorded it all super smooth. It was very cool to see him and Andy interact and write to our loop.” “WHOA” (feat. Kurt Rosenwinkel) JDB: “DOMi wrote the first part of this tune when she was 12. It was on a random Sibelius session that she played by accident, and I loved it. I knew we had to do a song with it, and Kurt felt like the perfect fit. We met him through the drummer Louis Cole when we were in New York in 2019. A week after he had the track, he sent it back with him soloing from beginning to end. It was perfect.” “SNiFF” DL: “The original title for this was ‘You Can Sniff My Butt’. JD wrote it in 2018, all in one go in front of me—and it’s one of my favourite things he’s ever made. We played it at every show as a closer and people loved its pace, so it felt like a good idea to close the record with it too. It was one of the earliest songs we came up with together.” “THANK U” JDB: “This used to be a crazy loop in a 13 time signature, which was called ‘Dermatologist’ because DOMi had just learned what that word was. We wrote it in an Airbnb somewhere in 2018 and then, when we came back to it a few years later for this record, we realised it was perfect to send to the mini-orchestra who played on the intro. It rounds out the album really well.”",

It isn’t to say it’s easy music (45 tightly collaged minutes of spoken word, free jazz, electronic loops and fragmentary hip-hop)—only that it makes space for the listener in ways she hasn’t always in the past. Given the album’s subject matter—jazz history, the nature and place of Black art—it’s easy to hear the shift as one from personal expression to stewardship and communication: She wants you to understand where she’s coming from as a gesture of respect to those who came before, whether Woody Shaw (“WOODY SHAW”), Mary Lou Williams (“ODE TO MARY”) or Joe McPhee (“JOE MCPHEE NATION TIME”). Her fellow travellers—multi-hyphenate Black artists like AKAI SOLO and Melanie Charles—show you she isn’t alone. And while the difficulty lingers, it gets explicit purpose, courtesy of professor, artist and activist Thomas Stanley on the outro: “Ultimately, perhaps, it is good that people abandoned jazz\/Replaced it with musical products better-suited to capitalism’s designs\/Now jazz jumps up like Lazarus if we allow it, to rediscover itself as a living music.”",

        "id" : "1579117958",
        "notes" : "Duncan Bellamy and Jack Wyllie had a more productive lockdown than most in 2020. The drummer and saxophonist pair, who make up the London-based jazz and electronic group Portico Quartet, recorded two albums in only a matter of months. The first, Terrain, arrived in May 2021 and is a three-track, minimalist exploration of melodic loops and textural atmospheres. It is followed by Monument, a concise encapsulation of the Portico Quartet sound. Where Terrain dug into lengthy meditative compositions, Monument traverses everything from the driving groove of “Impressions” to the krautrock-referencing “Ultraviolet” and the strings-laden, cinematic melodies of “On the Light”. “There isn’t much wastage in Monument,” saxophonist Wyllie tells Apple Music. “It feels like this sculptural, composed exploration of our sound and evolution over the years.” Read on for his thoughts on the album, track by track.\n“Opening” “Our process generally works with us individually building ideas over the course of a month and then in the following month we work together to make them into tunes. This track began with an idea that Duncan had and that I added some sax and synth to, as well as recorded strings. We did a lot of studio work on it afterwards by running it back through delays to give it a sense of space and ambience.”\n“Impressions” “This is a recognisably Portico Quartet tune, featuring the hang drum, which is a key part of the identity of the band. It's similar to the track ‘Ruins’ from our third album, but this is more up front and direct. There's a nice contrast between the rhythmic groove that is quite big and then the sax, which is played very gently. There's a load of vocal samples that we sang on too in the background. All of that helps make up its ambient textures.”\n“Ultraviolet” “This is contrastingly quite different from our earlier music. It's got a krautrock groove to it, as well as that pitched saxophone at the start and the Prophet synth line that Duncan's playing. At this point in the record, we felt like you need to have a bit of propulsion, since you've come out of the intro into something quite up front and now you want to keep on driving through.”\n“Ever Present” “Duncan wrote the piano part, and I liked the simplicity of it. We put it back through some modulated reverb to give it a woozy effect, and then my saxophone melody references our earlier work with its melodic economy. Duncan's playing bass on it as well—it’s quite busy underneath the melody, but it fits together nicely.”\n“Gateway” “We didn't have any interludes on the album at first, but after we sent it in to the record label, they said it felt slightly too full-on and needed a bit of space to breathe. We had already written this hang drum melody and the one on ‘Portal’, which we then slid into the track listing. It gives the album a different pace and allowed it to be an easier listen.”\n“Monument” “This started with a vocal loop, in a similar feel to an earlier track of ours called ‘Endless’. I added a very simple melodic sax sound to the loop that is then quite heavily manipulated through effects pedals. The whole song is supposed to feel like a journey, where the listener is taken through these different sonic worlds and ends up in an entirely new space.”\n“A.O.E” “The connection between the tracks and their titles is sometimes so abstract for us—we just go with whatever feels like it works. We spend so long doing them; it could take three months to write the album and three months to do the sequencing and titles. This stands for ‘Age of Enlightenment’, since Duncan and I were both reading an article about it at the time. It's one of my favourite tunes, since I really like how it cuts between these two sections, switching from electronic drums to acoustic drums and then the soaring sax and cello melody.”\n“Warm Data” “After we've separately worked with each other's ideas, we usually go to a recording studio and turn them into pieces of music by re-recording everything. With ‘Warm Data’, we jammed most of it in a studio that had a Steinway piano. We improvised along to a groove that Duncan had already written, and then after we'd recorded it, we chopped it up and made it more coherent.”\n“Portal” “We probably could have turned ‘Gateway’ and ‘Portal’ into more fleshed-out tunes of their own, but they fit on this album perfectly as interludes. They are both hang drum melodies processed through reverb and delay. They're functional tracks, but they are also essential to the listening experience of the record as a whole.”\n“On the Light” “This is classic Portico territory. Duncan initially wrote the drum and bass grooves and then I built the melodies on top. It's a really nice way to finish the record, since the strings come in at the end and elevate it into a cinematic feel. It was lovely to have the strings players Simmy Singh and Francesca Ter-Berg in the studio with us, helping with the arrangements. It's a celebratory way to end the album.”",

Not only does Parks—aka the LA-based singer, songwriter and violinist Sudan Archives—sound more idiosyncratic, but she’s able to wield her idiosyncrasies with more power and purpose. It’s catchy but not exactly pop (“Home Maker”), embodied but not exactly R&B (“Ciara”), weird without ever being confrontational (“It’s Already Done”), and it rides the line between live sound and electronic manipulation like it didn’t exist. She wants to practice self-care (“Selfish Soul”), but she also just wants to “have my titties out” (“NBPQ [Topless]”), and over the course of 55 minutes, she makes you wonder if those aren’t at least sometimes the same thing. And the album’s sheer variety isn’t so much an expression of what Parks wants to try as the multitudes she already contains.",

Formerly the guitarist\/vocalist for Sydney, Australia, shoegaze trio Dark Bells, she relocated to London and made a name for herself as a DJ thanks to meticulous crate-digging and trippy flourishes she adds to her sets. Both qualities shine on this album, with lead single “Bodies of Water” memorably contrasting Throssell’s slow, dreamy vocals with crackling techno motifs. Baby, We’re Ascending also boasts high-profile collaborators, from ambient keyboardist\/composer Jon Hopkins on the radiant title track to Hot Chip’s Alexis Taylor on the string-swept “Biggest Mood Ever”. Meanwhile, spoken-word poet Kai-Isaiah Jamal and singer Obi Franky hold hypnotic sway over assorted slippery contours on “Human Sound”.",

        "notes" : "Absurdly impressive album from this Welshman. Took him 10 years according to the reviews, while in the meantime working on album for FKA twigs and the likes.\nThis album is innovative in so many ways; the use of electronics in an almost classical music kind of way. Famous number are of cours Joy Squad (already discovered in mixes from Jamie XX and others) and Black Rainbow but all tracks on this album have their own beauty.\n\nFrom Pitchfork:\n“Arriving a full 10 years after his debut single, Welsh producer Lewis Roberts’ first album is a bravura display of brain-bending editing that’s more concerned with big feelings.”\n\nAnother review:\n“Welsh producer Lewis Roberts – aka Koreless – released his debut single a decade ago. There have been a couple more singles and even a couple of EPs since – but this is his debut full-length album. A lot of time has been taken refining his sound, as when he arrived on the scene, the result is a project that has its own distinct sound but takes from many forms, not just dub\/dance\/ambient\/techno\/house worlds but also contemporary classical.\n\nThey say you can’t be all things to all people but I wonder if Agor is an argument very nearly against that – there’s all sorts here for sure. Opener, Yonder, is barely ever with us, some ambient thumps signaling an arrival. But when it folds over into Black Rainbow we have a kind of clipped techno, that has no actual driving pulse but is all forward momentum. It’s like Oneohtrix Point Never and John Hopkins wrestling over control of how best to steer and shape an Omni Trio remix. And that’s a place I’m very happy to be.\n\nBut then another result. Primes is barely a minute long and seems to exist to palette-cleanse as much as anything.\n\nAcross the last decade Roberts has earned income and honed skills producing for acts on the pop part of the dance spectrum or at the dance end of the pop spectrum, or however you might say it, people like FKA Twiggs – it’s not just been an earner, it’s been how he has shaped his sound and ideas. Though there’s no pop remnants here – instead we get “serious composer” mode after our intro notes.\n\nWhite Picket Fence features a wordless soprano voice fitting in and around the debris of a broken techno track. It’s exhilarating, and again the music rolls over into Act(s), a soft comedown ahead of the next new wave of music – the more playful Joy Squad. Guest vocals are chopped and diced and sprinkled across this song and also Frozen and Shellshock before the very soundtrack-y Hance, our final reset before this brief album’s longest track, a closing piece of cut-up collage called Strangers.\nIt’s sound-art but there’s always the feeling of forward movement. It’s dance music but no one would ever actually ‘dance’ to it. It’s as serious as Michael Nyman or Philip Glass or Steve Reich but more likely to be embraced by fans of Aphex Twin and Daniel Lopatin and Jenny Hval. I think it’s mesmeric, absolutely wonderful.”\n",

Its sessions recorded over the course of seven years, between multiple projects and releases, In These Times is McCraven’s sixth album as a bandleader, and it showcases the virtuosic instrumentalists he has spent his career building an almost telepathic bond with—bassist Junius Paul and guitarist Jeff Parker among them. It’s also the warmest and most enveloping album he’s produced to date. Frenetic beat-splicing might underpin the polyrhythms of tracks such as “Seventh String” and “This Place That Place”, but the soft melodies played by Parker and harpist Brandee Younger always permeate—a reminder of the clarity of the moment of creation, rather than its post-production manipulation. Indeed, In These Times is a reflection of the past decade of McCraven’s instrumental expertise, but it’s also a powerful reminder of the freedom inherent in this time, in the here and now of making music together, when the artist lets go and surrounds us with the ineffable beauty of collective creation.",

        "notes" : "In early 2021, Tom and Ed Russell were working on a mix for the iconic London club fabric. They knew they wanted a particular tune included, but simply couldn’t find the track anywhere or remember its name. Faced with a deadline and an endless dig through disc logs, the pair changed their approach: They would themselves write the song they could hear. The track became June 2021 single “So U Kno”—an insidious, addictive banger that’s a cornerstone of the Russells’ debut album as Overmono. It’s an anecdote that reveals a great deal about the brothers’ practical mindset and prodigious abilities. Veterans of the UK dance scene (Tom, the elder Russell, released techno as Truss, while Ed put out drum ’n’ bass as Tessela), the Welsh-raised producers combine for something special here. Good Lies is an extraordinary electronic record: a genre-defying set glistening with purpose, poise and dance-floor delirium. “The main anchor for the album isn’t genre-based, it’s an emotional place,” Ed tells Apple Music. “It’s a particular emotional sense that we try and achieve with a lot of our music—depending on what mood you’re in on that day, you could interpret that state in a few different ways.” Tom is able to pinpoint the origins to that “emotional ambiguity”. “I think our formative experiences of partying in the Welsh countryside had a massive impact on us,” he says. “When you have the sun going down and the sun coming up, and those emotions of somewhere between euphoria, slight sadness that the night’s coming an end but a real sense of optimism that you’re going into a new day. These sorts of weird crossover points are what we try and find in how we put our music together.” Read on for the brothers’ track-by-track guide. “Feelings Plain” Ed Russell: “It was originally going to close the album. We wanted to see if we could make a sort of plainsong piece of music—13th-century church music, where someone would be singing one note over and over and then someone else joins in, and everyone’s singing these cyclical things. But when it all comes together, they start cycling differently and you get this big wash of voices. But we wanted to try and do a sort of R&B take on plainsong—it was one of the songs that had a more conceptual start to it.” Tom Russell: “It was the furthest we’d gotten in terms of direct new avenues that we might explore. It’s a bold statement of intent to start.” “Arla Fearn” ER: “When did you first write this bassline, Tom?” TR: “About 1976. No, I think it was about 15 years ago.” ER: “I would tell Tom it’s the best thing he’d ever written. It’s got so much mood and character and just sounds so satisfying to me.” TR: “I know Ed meant it as a compliment but I kept on taking it as a bit of a diss really. But I finally gave in.” ER: “We spent ages processing the drums and then Tom sampled the Geovarn vocal and came up with the insane outro. The track is at 135 BPM, and by the end it’s at 170 BPM, but you never really notice it’s changed—it just flips the vocal into a different spot. We really wanted the album to be a place where tracks would often morph into something completely different. That it’s bubbling over with ideas.” “Good Lies” ER: “We went through a phase of trying not to sample every Smerz song because they just had so many good hooks. They’re incredible at writing these top lines that sound straight off early-2000s garage records, but not in a pastiche way. We had the vocal from [2018 Smerz track] “No harm” and spent a lot of time chopping it into the phrasing we wanted and creating a hook out of this little section that had jumped out at us. The demo for the instrumental then came together in a day, but there was an 18-month, almost two-year period from writing the demo to coming back and starting to really chip away at it.” “Good Lies (Outro)” TR: “When we were writing the ‘Good Lies’ instrumental, we thought we’d see if we could flip it and turn the vibe on its head into something moodier. It’s always going back to that ambiguity with us. There’s something of that in the Good Lies title. What constitutes a good lie?” “Walk Thru Water” (feat. St. Panther) TR: “Ed was at my studio in February [2022], and we were battening down the hatches for Storm Eunice.” ER: “It was this quite nice feeling of, ‘All right, there’s a storm coming, we’ve got loads of snacks and a few drinks, the place to ourselves, and we can’t go anywhere.’ Tom had written these really beautiful chords and I’d kept saying I wanted to do something with them. We got really stoned while the rain was coming down, listening to these chords, and we came across the St. Panther vocal.” TR: “I then started doing the beat on the Pulsar—which is a drum machine that’s quite difficult to tame but on certain things it just works beautifully.” “Cold Blooded” TR: “This started out as something quite different. It dawned on us that we’d written this massive IDM tune.” ER: “It was a bit too nice, wasn’t it?” TR: “It was this late-’90s breakdance thing—not really the vibe we should be going for.” ER: “I had this Kindora sample that I’d wanted to use for ages, and then Tom sent me this slowed-down version of ‘Cold Blooded’ with the new drums and I realised it’d be fucking killer. It then became a month of last-minute adjustments, which we sometimes get ourselves into a bit of a hole with. Tweaking everything until the last.” “Skulled” ER: “We had the Kelly Erez sample put away into our sample folder. And then we built a drum machine—a copy of a ’70s drum machine called the Syncussion, made by Pearl, the drum kit manufacturer. It [the Syncussion] was meant to sound like a normal drum kit, and it sounds so far away from real drums it’s insane. We spent a couple of weeks trying to make our version sound like we’d soldered it not quite right. It has this weird, sort of dry, alien, ’80s vibe to it. Like with all our stuff, it’s processed so heavily.” TR: “Ed has come up with this mad compression chain, which you can basically put any sort of drums into and you get this massive wall of noise.” ER: “I said earlier the best thing Tom has written was the bassline on ‘Arla Fearn’, but I’ve changed my mind now: It’s the piano outro to ‘Skulled’. We both loved the idea of the song ending like a classic ballad—a Céline Dion tune.” “Sugarushhh” TR: “We liked the idea of trying to shoehorn in a screaming 303 to the album somewhere.” ER: “Tom’s good at doing these quite irregular things that you don’t immediately notice. This, if you actually count it out, is in some weird time signature and it’s cycling every nine bars. It was also really important that we had this abrasive, aggressive 303 line being offset completely with a really beautiful vocal.” “Calon” ER: “Tom played me the first iteration of this in the back of a van on the way to a festival in Minehead. We’ve sampled Joe Trufant a few times before and we liked the idea of there being a few familiar voices on the album.” TR: “We then hired a studio in Ibiza and Ed had the idea of making the beat much slower. It became this big, slowed-down house tune—it dropped to something like 110 BPM.” ER: “We were in a US club sound-checking and played through some tunes from the album. Hearing it on the club system we were like, ‘Fuck me!’ It’s this sneaky banger.” “Is U” ER: “We’ve both been massive Tirzah fans since the start, and one day the ‘All I want is you’ line from ‘Gladly’ just jumped out of the speaker at us. We then spent ages trying to make the beat on this mono machine we have, which has all these really shit ’80s drum samples. We just mangled them until we had the beat, and then chopped up the vocal to get what we felt was a really strong and more confrontational delivery. Tom then put these lush chords in the breakdown and it opens the track up, like the sun coming out from behind a cloud.” TR: “It’s amazing when a track starts to take on a life of its own. Playing this out and seeing the reaction gives me goosebumps every time.” “Vermonly” ER: “A lot of our tracks will be written on just one piece of gear and we see what you can do with it. I had bought Tom a synth for his birthday, but when I gave it to him he said he wasn’t going to be in the studio for a few days, so I asked if I could take the synth I had just given him. I sent him a really rough 16-bar loop with the main melodic ideas, and he did the rest, really.” TR: “Tracks like this are really important to us. They might get lost on an EP. It’s not always about writing dance-floor bangers.” “So U Kno” ER: “We were doing this mix for fabric and we both knew we wanted a very particular tune in the mix but couldn’t find it. So we basically just thought, ‘Fuck it, it’ll be quicker to write something ourselves.’ I had a chopped-up vocal and a rough beat going, played it to Tom, who went straight over to a Jupiter-6 synth and immediately played the bassline before doing the same with the chords.” “Calling Out” TR: “Ed had suggested to try and sample something by slowthai and I managed to find this little [section] I really liked from quite an obscure track called ‘Dead Leaves’. I loved the line ‘I’m like the sun, I rise up and then gone.’ Then we combined it with a CASISDEAD and d’Eon sample and it really started to make sense. I have a tendency to overcomplicate things, but Ed is often able to say, ‘We don’t need that’, or ‘Change a snare from there to there’. A tiny idea or decision can make such a huge difference.” ER: “I remember when Tom sent me the chords for the end and I felt like it reminded me of old Radiohead—the perfect way to close the album.”",

        "notes" : "The caveat with mentioning the 30 years of history John McEntire and Sam Prekop shared before making Sons Of is that the album doesn’t exactly sound like anything they’ve done before. McEntire is the drummer of the adventurous, anything-but-rock band Tortoise and the Prekop-fronted Sea and Cake; Prekop is a singer-songwriter who rebutted the harshness of ’90s indie rock with music influenced by lounge jazz and bossa nova. Sons Of, by contrast, is made up of four lengthy synth improvisations combining early house, indie pop and the spacey, ruminative side of IDM. The connective tissue is in the approach, which is somehow adventurous but gentle, experimental but restrained. And while everything here has narrative momentum, their shared language is thick enough that they sound better the longer they go (the sunglasses-indoors sci-fi of “Ascending by Night” and the 24-minute “A Yellow Robe”).",

It feels almost intrusive at first to listen to what originated as private musical thoughts, conceived on synthesiser and piano out of an innate need for the presence of pure, unadorned sounds. Sakamoto’s choice of 12 favourite sketches, each named for its date of composition, charts the stages of his recovery, from pieces infused with his laboured breathing to a sublime final sequence of impressionistic miniatures.",

        "id" : "1610345642",
        "notes" : "“If I ever win a Grammy, I’m gonna thank him,” Queens-born vocalist, producer and multi-disciplinary artist Yaya Bey tells Apple Music about one of the many songs on Remember Your North Star inspired by an unnamed ex-lover. He was a music industry player and that relationship, which lasted some three years, revealed many things to Bey—not just about the industry itself, but about who she is and what she values. “It was like, ‘Well, where am I going? Where am I headed and what should I remember?’ And I guess in trying to move towards love—love for self, love romantically, platonically—I’m remembering that that’s where I’m going. That’s my North Star.” While that relationship opened her eyes to some of the industry’s—and men at large’s—more sordid practices, Bey managed to keep her joy intact, delivering a robust collection of music that spans Billie Holiday-inspired jazz crooning, lovers rock reggae and the bubbling form of South African house, amapiano. Within these spoonfuls of sugar, Bey supplies medicine aplenty, lambasting the intrinsically toxic systems that would, at one time, have her questioning her own self-worth. “To be a woman in this male-dominated industry means you get judged and valued by things that really don’t matter,” she says. “But I can’t have apprehension about what I do with my music because it’s the only place I have a voice. Being a Black woman, an up-and-coming artist, and especially in my thirties, the only place I have a voice is in my music. I can’t be silent there. I’ll just disappear.” Below, Bey takes us through some of the key tracks on Remember Your North Star, a project that casts her more visible than ever. “Intro” “So, [talk show host] Wendy Williams had said some shit about [vegan lifestyle influencer] Tabitha Brown on her show. And then Tabitha Brown retaliated in this way that insinuated Wendy Williams doesn’t know love or doesn’t have anyone to love her. And then someone on Black Twitter tweeted that even though Tabitha Brown didn’t say very much, we all knew it was an insult because we all kind of know Black women have a wound around not being loved and not knowing love. And that got me to thinking about how Black women respond to that. There’s the ‘city girl’ approach, which is like, ‘Fuck love, just provide for me financially’—and all of it is defense mechanisms—because a lot of times we’re afraid to ask for the things that we want, or we assume that we can’t get the things that we want, emotionally. I’m saying, ‘N****s going to n***a, so you might as well get paid.’ That’s just my take on not feeling secure that men will show up in a way that is supportive of my emotional needs.” “big daddy ya” “I was having this realisation that most all of my problems can somehow be tied to either racism, patriarchy or capitalism—literally everything in my life that’s going wrong. And as it pertains to patriarchy, misogyny and all that shit, it’s always just fucking men at the root of my problems. Even when it’s a woman, it’s still some woman enacting patriarchy, enacting misogyny. What I learned about the male ego is just to laugh at it because it’s utterly ridiculous. It isn’t built on supporting the collective, uplifting the collective. It’s built on scarcity and that’s why it’s so fragile. And so, ‘big daddy ya’ is just me mocking men.” “nobody knows” “I had just signed to Ninja Tune, and they sent me to D.C. to start the album. It was one of the first songs that I wrote. I had been going back and forth with this guy for three years, and we weren’t in contact at the time. And he was bouncing back and forth between me and this other woman. I was really fucked up because I had lost my job. Like, the song starts off, ‘I ain’t paid my rent in three months’—that was very true for me. And this guy, the last time I saw him, he was rubbing it in my face that [his other woman] is a doctor and I’m unemployed. I have to work so hard under the system of capitalism to be worthy. I can’t just wake up in the morning and be worthy. I have to have all of these things to be worthy of love, to be worthy of a roof over my head. Me just being me is not enough for this world—I think it’s a song that means the most to me on the album because I was at my lowest point, but I was still fighting for myself.” “alright” “I was listening to a lot of Frankie Beverly & Maze, and what I like about Frankie Beverly & Maze is that they make music to uplift the spirit. I knew I needed live musicians because a lot of the album was made on a 404 or from sliced samples. It’s all digital. [My friend] Temi introduced me to [co-producer] Aja Grant, and it was easy. It was a jam session sort of thing. I just hummed out the melody lines and they picked it up, and then added to it and extended it.” “meet me in brooklyn” “My family is from Barbados. I always say that I’m an African American of Western Indian descent. I grew up deeply in both cultures. So, I felt like I needed to put some of that on the album because it’s part of who I am. And the album, overall, is about me dealing with and navigating misogyny externally and internally, and even internalised misogyny through my romantic dealings. And some of romance is about fun, like when you first meet someone at a party—like, the first time I ever danced with a boy was at a reggae party. So, it’s in my DNA, and culturally and socially growing up in New York, and I wanted to include that sound.” “pour up” (feat. DJ Nativesun) “My friend Chris is an amazing DJ, and he plays a lot of house and dance, and I was working on a song with another artist at a session in D.C. at this big house that had all these little studio rooms. Chris comes into the session, and he has a track. At first, I was afraid because it’s amapiano. But when I think about the music that’s coming out of Africa, that’s dancehall, that’s soca, it’s house music—and I think, once we get past the whole diaspora wars thing, all of us fighting for the scraps, we’re all Africans at the very bottom of this capitalist, imperialist food chain. Because you can’t talk about Fela without talking about James Brown without talking about [Wizkid’s] Made in Lagos—that was an Afrobeats album because it was made by an African from Nigeria, but if we take that away, that was a dancehall record. At first, I was afraid that I would experience some backlash, but when I thought about it, I’m like amapiano is house music, and I’m allowed to be a part of the conversation.” “reprise” “Sometimes relationships that you go through are a catalyst for you to get to know yourself more, or for you to really see where you’re playing yourself, where you’re doubting yourself, where you are not showing up for yourself. It’s really about how I had a lack of self-worth, and I was afraid to see myself as capable. And I had this other song where I was, like, tearing his ass a new one. But it was coming from a place that was more about bashing him than it was about uplifting me. And it isn’t really my desire to bash anyone. So, I didn’t put the song out and, instead, I wrote ‘reprise’, which is more reflecting on how I got to where I am, and the things that I’ve seen. It gave me a space to even have compassion for him because he’s somebody with his own trauma and insecurities that are informing the way he’s moving through the world.” “rolling stoner” “I probably smoke the heaviest when I’m going through shit. Two months before the pandemic started, I was working 13-hour shifts in a homeless shelter, seeing crazy shit. I’m riddled with guilt because I’m working there, and I feel like I’m a part of the problem. Even though I’m just an art teacher there, it’s still like I shouldn’t be here because this is hella problematic. I come home, I smoke my life away, I make music, I go to sleep for two hours. I do it again. I mean, I had smoked before then, but that was my introduction to, ‘Now I’m a pothead.’” “i’m certain she’s there” “So, my parents were teenage parents. My mom, she didn’t raise me. She came from different circumstances. Her family was not as supportive. Her mom died. Her dad was just really disappointed that she had a baby so young. And my dad, on the other hand, he just had more support, more help raising me. Either people don’t ever talk about my mom at all, like she’s this thing that never happened, or they have terrible things to say about her. Which, as a child, it fucked with my own self-image, to have this mom that is a pariah, I guess. So, as I got older, I realised that some of that is misogyny. And I just wanted to address that.” “street fighter blues“ “‘Street fighter blues’ was the starting point of the album. I had someone else that I was supposed to work with, and the session was a nightmare. I ended up snatching my equipment out the wall and leaving. But then, I called my friend Nate Jarvis, who is a longtime collaborator, and once I got in the right environment, it was easy. I was listening to a lot of Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan, which is what informed the vocals. And then, I went on the 404 and sampled my voice, busted out a drum pattern and it was over with.” “mama loves her son” “A long, long time ago, I had this conversation with my friend, and she was like her mother—always kind of taught her not to trust women. And we’re taught not to trust women and not to trust ourselves because we see other women as competition for male validation. It’s not even just romantic male validation, it’s just love from men, acknowledgement from men—in the workplace, in friendships, in social settings, on social media, in relationships, in every power dynamic in marginalised groups. I needed a way to address the way that women act out misogyny.” “blessings” “I wrote ‘blessings’ when I was in D.C. It’s one of the first songs I wrote. At the time, I was not talking to the same person I’ve been talking about. We were not on speaking terms. I guess I was going through breakup blues. I felt like I wasn’t enough for that person, and I was figuring out how to be enough for myself. But at the same time, I was in D.C. A label had paid for me to go out there and make an album. I was too sad to get out of bed, but if I could just get out of this funk and realise there’s blessings around me, I could find a way to be present for them. And wherever you are, a person needs that. And life goes on, with time, you know?”",

        "notes" : "Unique, strong and sexy—that’s how Beyoncé wants you to feel while listening to RENAISSANCE. Crafted during the grips of the pandemic, her seventh solo album is a celebration of freedom and a complete immersion into house and dance that serves as the perfect sound bed for themes of liberation, release, self-assuredness and unfiltered confidence across its 16 tracks. RENAISSANCE is playful and energetic in a way that captures that Friday-night, just-got-paid, anything-can-happen feeling, underscored by reiterated appeals to unyoke yourself from the weight of others’ expectations and revel in the totality of who you are. From the classic four-on-the-floor house moods of the Robin S.- and Big Freedia-sampling lead single “BREAK MY SOUL” to the Afro-tech of the Grace Jones- and Tems-assisted “MOVE” and the funky, rollerskating disco feeling of “CUFF IT”, this is a massive yet elegantly composed buffet of sound, richly packed with anthemic morsels that pull you in. There are soft moments here, too: “I know you can’t help but to be yourself around me,” she coos on “PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA”, the kind of warm, whispers-in-the-ear love song you’d expect to hear at a summer cookout—complete with an intricate interplay between vocals and guitar that gives Beyoncé a chance to showcase some incredible vocal dexterity. “CHURCH GIRL” fuses R&B, gospel and hip-hop to tell a survivor’s story: “I'm finally on the other side\/I finally found the extra smiles\/Swimming through the oceans of tears we cried.” An explicit celebration of Blackness, “COZY” is the mantra of a woman who has nothing to prove to anyone—“Comfortable in my skin\/Cozy with who I am,” ” Beyoncé muses on the chorus. And on “PURE\/HONEY”, Beyoncé immerses herself in ballroom culture, incorporating drag performance chants and a Kevin Aviance sample on the first half that give way to the disco-drenched second half, cementing the song as an immediate dance-floor favourite. It’s the perfect lead-in to the album closer “SUMMER RENAISSANCE”, which propels the dreamy escapist disco of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” even further into the future.",

        "notes" : "Like L’Rain, Fatigue is marbled with personal recordings: Dishes being washed in the sink beneath a piano melody on “Need Be,” a voicemail from her mother buried in “Blame Me.” The clips imbue the music with fleeting traces of closeness and familiarity. Cheek approaches them from a distance, recontextualizing some of the most heartfelt or difficult moments of her life in song. The mercurial, six-minute highlight “Find It” begins downcast, with a metronomic synth loop and the repeated mantra, “Make a way out of no way.” Screams echo through the sluggish beat as coming through a wall; the dust settles on an organist and singer performing the gospel song “I Won’t Complain,” recorded at the funeral of a family friend. Cheek intones over it until the song crests in a rapturous, overwhelming finale, with no less than 13 musicians contributing to the commotion. It’s easily the most poignant song she has ever made, a deeply felt, Biblically minded portrait of forging a path out of darkness. Yet the journey has room for lightness and humor, too, like the “oops” that slips into the end of “Walk Through” or the wacky vocal affect of a former roommate on “Love Her.” On the brief “Black Clap” and the rhythmic, low-lit “Suck Teeth,” Cheek incorporates the percussive sounds of a handclap game she made up with multi-instrumentalist Ben Chapoteau-Katz, a way to pay tribute to the joyful sound of childhood hand games played by Black girls.\n\nCheek upends expectations in more direct pop and dance traditions, too. On “Two Face,” a roving piano line and stuttering samples melt into a soulful, psychedelic throb as she ruminates on a failed friendship. “I can’t build no new nothing no new life no new nothing for me,” she trills in a singsong cadence, the words bouncing over oscillated coos. The lyrics on the tense “Kill Self” are even more unforgiving: “Did you see me chew myself out?” she asks, voice rippling in a cascade over shuffling percussion. “Hear the gnawing?” At once the album’s darkest and most propulsive moment, “Kill Self” eventually assumes a seething dancefloor pulse, bending skillfully toward structure without abandoning Cheek’s wandering impulses.\n\nFatigue ends with the beatific “Take Two,” a spare reconfiguration of “Bat” from L’Rain. She repurposes the song in a similar way to her field recordings, as raw material to mold into an unfamiliar shape. Stripped bare of percussion and transformed into an airy, droning spiritual, Cheek’s voice unfurls in billowy, Auto-Tuned tones as she repeats the words, “I am not prepared for what is going to happen to me.” In her skyward voice, the sentiment is more life-affirming than terrifying, suggestive of infinite possibilities. There is no fixed road toward healing, Fatigue reassures us; there is only the way forward.",

        "notes" : "When Fred again.. began work on Actual Life 2 (February 22 - October 15 2021), the BRIT Award-winning producer saw it as a way to close the book on the most traumatic period of his life. Still processing the grief of losing a loved one, he imagined that making his second solo album would be a way to get through and move on. Instead, he learned that life doesn’t work that way. Grief has long legs. “I was like, ‘Yeah, OK, this is going to be the journey through grief, from it being there and unbearable to it all being solved,” Fred Gibson, the man behind the handle, tells Apple Music. “By the end, I was like, ‘This is an ever-going thing, and this is just one chapter of it.’” Following up on his debut, Actual Life (April 14 - December 17 2020), released in April 2021, it’s a soulful and emotional dance record. Blending euphoric bangers and atmospheric electronica, it confirms the producer who’s collaborated with Headie One, Stormzy, Romy, Ed Sheeran and FKA Twigs as an exhilarating artist in his own right.\nLike its predecessor, Actual Life 2 (February 22 - October 15 2021) uses snippets and samples from real-life events and conversations as the foundation for intricate soundscapes. “As soon as I make a song, I start dragging in shit from my iPhone, a bunch of voice notes that I’ve recorded from around the world,” says Gibson. “I just love the way that feels, so much more than opening up some dry synth and playing some notes.” Gibson says Actual Life is an ongoing project, each LP a snapshot of his life in that particular era. “I’m going to do this forever now. It’ll be like chapters. I’m obsessed with it.” Let Fred again.. guide you through this phase, track by track.\n“February 2nd 2021” “It’s the first sample I found. It’s picking up from where the last album ended, beginning to try and move on from a thing. It felt very clearly like it needed to be at the beginning.”\n“Catrin (The City)” “I thought this lyric was just really beautiful and very much resonated with me. I adore London, and I always have, and I always will. I make most of my music just out in the city, just on benches or in museums. My real brother on this record felt like the city. It just felt very clear and honest to me that this was how the album needed to begin. I only sing four lines in this tune, but they’re like flashbacks. I see them as being montage flashbacks at different moments from last year. And then it moves forward again.”\n“Roze (Forgive)” “This is a sample I’d found on Instagram—someone in his bedroom singing this song. To me the feeling of it was it’s still not moving forward, it’s still reflecting on the past. But it was at least a step in there being a nostalgia over it—it wasn’t present tense. It was like, ‘This is what’s happened’. The main breakthrough on that was finding the thing of doing it with the strings. I’m going to record a version of it actually with a string orchestra, which will be fun.”\n“Gigi (What You Went Through)” “This is [London singer-songwriter] Gigi Moss, a sample of her singing at a pub. Sometimes it’s very much as simple as just stumbling across someone saying what I’d want to say and then I’ll be like, ‘OK, thank you for holding my hand through that. You need to carry on helping me, and I can sample it so I can sing around it.’ I find it hard to go from a white, blank page to singing it myself off of nothing. But if there’s someone else there singing it with me, I see it as a safety blanket.”\n“Kahan (Last Year)” [feat. Kodak Black] “For a while, there was a version of this where I wanted it to feel like I was out of my mind, chaotic and claustrophobic. Then my brother, who I work with on lots of music, was like, ‘What if you make the opposite interpretation, just a piano?’ As soon as it was on piano, it was able to breathe. And then I was like, ‘OK, I would want to sing on this now. I need to tell my part of the story.’ It becomes more of a duet. The whole record is very much in memory mode of the previous year, and I think this song summarises that.”\n“Tate (How I Feel)” “The lyric is saying, ‘I don’t know how I feel’—just that over and over again. The music sounds more positive, which I think was just how I was feeling. I couldn’t work out if it was a good or a bad thing. I think, in hindsight, it was just a pending thing. I thought I was through it. I was like, ‘We’re getting to the good bit and to a good state of mind’. But that was definitely, definitely not the case.”\n“Hannah (The Sun)” “It’s in the same portion of time [of ‘Tate (How I Feel)’], of that feeling of thinking the sun’s coming through, there’s an optimism here. It was short-lived but real. I like things when the answer isn’t, ‘Yeah, and then that was that and that’s it, done’. I like it more when it’s like, ‘It really felt like it was that, but it was a total fallacy, and you were totally wrong two weeks later.’ I’m into that side of it; it feels more human.”\n“Carlos (Interlude)” “Carlos is the OG. He’s the first person I met that I sampled. And I adore him and feel forever indebted to him. I’m going to try and track him down at the beginning of next year when I’m in America. Every album will sample Carlos somewhere. I like the challenge of finding new ways of using this little, 14-second video I have with Carlos. I’ve made 20 songs out of it.”\n“Faisal (Envelops Me)” “This is probably the song that means the most to me on the record. The verse is very much about the traumas of the year before, but I think the chorus is representing a hug of the beautiful people I have around me. I think I was coming out of the short-lived sun moment and realising that this would be a lifelong thing. I think traumas and grief, it gets less frenetic and there—but then it just becomes part of you. It doesn’t just disappear. It just becomes you. And that’s not a bad thing; it’s just a true thing. I was making peace with the fact that there would be no leaving this behind.”\n“Tayla (Every Night)” “I love this sample. It’s of this amazing singer called Tayla Parx. It’s a song that we actually wrote together a time ago, but it was a ballad—it’s a song I’ve made quite a few versions of. This one felt right for this moment in this record. Before it picked up, I wanted it to have this stiller, more washed, padded moment of just a few lyrics before it starts to get some momentum.”\n“Tanya (Maybe Life)” “This is the beginning of a form of optimism. I like it sounding like all these loads of different voices, loads of different chops, loads of different people around you trying to help in different ways. There’s a chop of Tanya going, ‘Maybe life ain’t as bad as it seems.’ There’s a chop of Romy from The xx going, ‘You can lean on me, you can lean on me.’ There’s a chop of a whole host of other stuff, and they were representing the different people around me and the different approaches that—they’re all love, but just the different aspects of the people around me.”\n“Marco (And Everyone)” “I love making these reprise songs that summarise all the samples that you’ve heard in the record. On the last record, the reprise song was over this washy pad, and it was very ambient and still, so I was like, ‘OK, let’s try doing that same thing of finding a song that can incorporate everything you’ve heard, but in the opposite way of a super-driving beat.’ Also, I was like, ‘We’re picking up now; I want to be building a momentum.’”\n“Billie (Loving Arms)” “This is the real climax of the feeling of letting people help you, the most visceral incarnation of that. It feels like a pinger to me—just a proper, undiluted serotonin hit of falling into someone else. After a year of that whole aspect of things being gone, I think those things are even sweeter. This song felt like the pinnacle of allowing people in.”\n“Billie (Interlude)” “I knew that the record had to end with ‘Mollie’ because I was absolutely adamant it didn’t end with ‘Loving Arms’. It was so insincere for it to end on ‘Loving Arms’ because that so isn’t the truth of the end of the journey—not that there is an end. I wanted to end ‘Loving Arms’ in a way that it could get into ‘Mollie’ without it being too rogue. It needed to just pause for a second to allow it the space to breathe so it could go into that last song.”\n“Mollie (Hear Your Name)” “If ‘Loving Arms’ is the Saturday night, the reality is much more of a Sunday afternoon. That ‘Loving Arms’ serotonin hit isn’t a sustainable state of mind. It’s more like ‘Mollie’—‘OK, actually we are more here, and this is our cruise pace and that’s OK, and we’re going to try and marathon this out as opposed to some little sprint of a gassed-up pinger’s life.’”\n“15th October 2021” “This is literally just me, very ill in my bed, finishing the record. It’s just a message to someone, a little minute of stillness after ‘Mollie’.”",

        "id" : "1664550927",
        "notes" : "The artist meditates on grief through intricate blips and beats.\n\nFrom Pitchfork:\n\nLiv.e’s brilliant second album bends her expressive R&B into fearsome new shapes, acknowledging all the nuance and pain on the long journey to personal truth.\n\nCouldn’t Wait to Tell You, Liv.e’s debut LP, flipped through the pages of her diary quickly enough to animate her scattered musings on young romance while preserving each entry’s distinct perspective. Its allure rested on Liv.e’s charismatic storytelling, in her belief that “everybody got a love story” and her ability to play every role in those tales herself. Aggressively non-linear and rich in lo-fi charm, Couldn’t Wait to Tell You kept the proceedings light and easy. Even in the album’s darkest moments, Liv.e never felt more than 30 seconds away from a cathartic breakthrough, rescued by a tempo shift, a false ending, or the affirming words of a guest feature. She tore through dreamy realizations like outfits ripped off a garment rack, theorizing that a change of heart could be as easy as a change of costume.\n\nGirl in the Half Pearl cuts to the scene after the diary slams shut, when your face crashes into the pillow before a long and sleepless night. In place of Couldn’t Wait to Tell You’s rose-tinted psychedelia, Liv.e builds a mirror, surgically examining the ugliest parts of her subconscious and clawing toward her worst impulses and most frightening thoughts. Healing is a minefield of doubt and confusion, crossed only by necessity. Liv.e doesn’t waste time idealizing the process. “When I looked inside my brain, there were all these webs of pain,” she groans on opener “Gardetto.,” somersaulting over a wave of pitch-shifted oh nos. She strains like a petulant child, burnt out before the work even begins: “I just wanna play with my toys\/I’m too young for the world’s big problems.” Girl in the Half Pearl delves into the rich tension between deciding to change and taking the first step, dwelling in both the pain and promise of learning things about yourself that you sometimes wish you could forget. It’s a mesmerizing documentation of Liv.e’s ongoing rebirth that dares you to keep your eyes open during the scary parts.\n\nLiv.e heads a formidable ensemble of producers in soundtracking Girl in the Half Pearl’s compounding existential crises, eliciting career-high performances from accomplices new and old. Frequent Remi Wolf collaborator Solomonophonic and West Coast new age keyboardist John Carroll Kirby pull out all the stops for the fluorescent “Wild Animals,” wrapping its knowing eye roll to conniving men in trickling piano and the evergreen warmth of a brushed drum backbeat. Ever-reliable L.A. lysergist Mndsgn carves out a sizable chunk of real estate across the record, but lends a particularly inspired hand to “Find Out.” He digs deep in the crates, unearthing a jazzy, snare-less loop that thumps like an aching heartbeat, giving Liv.e’s decision to trade love’s rollercoaster for “precious time alone” the perfect dose of last-kiss sweetness. She walks away, a trilling synthesizer swirls in the mix, and the gut-wrenching resolve of her parting words (“I guess we’ll find out…the hard way”) cuts like a knife.\n\nBut true to the record’s “know thyself” thesis, Liv.e tackles the bulk of the production solo, rediscovering herself through electronica and noise, and dousing her R&B foundations in a stunning coat of fresh paint. The most satisfying moments push her to undertake fearsome experiments with her voice. She crashes into the breakbeats of “Ghost” with a metallic howl, roaring with frustration as she bitterly acknowledges her need for security—and recalls how it was denied to her in the past. “I know I said I don’t need the help\/Just wanna get back home,” she cries, and the syllables begin to catch in her throat before suddenly vanishing, swallowed by grief. On “Clowns,” Liv.e lures you into the tense moment before the emotional dam between two people bursts. At the breaking point, teasing percussion and sickly sweet strings erupt into gory pyrotechnics. “Can’t be clowns for this long, so baby what do we make it?” she screams, her words sparking against the blown-out crash of the drums.\n\nFor years, Liv.e has found a home among some of Black music’s most critically lauded experimentalists like Earl Sweatshirt, Pink Siifu, and Black Noi$e. If you come to Girl in the Half Pearl looking to find a soothing voice in the wilderness, you will instead find a complex maze of battered beats and warped shouts. The gripping soundscape doesn’t allow you to watch its protagonist’s transformation from the safety of the back row—it shoves you through the screen. If Liv.e’s going to “break the mirror 90 times” because she can’t stand to see herself, you’re going to help her sweep up the glass.\n\nWhen Liv.e announced Girl in the Half Pearl, she described it as a send-off for “people pleasing” behavior, and the album succeeds precisely because it feels so authentic and uncompromising: designed to serve only the needs of its creator. In burying the tender apology of “Snowing!” under a blanket of static, in applying a different vocal style and post-production technique to each vocal line of “Six Weeks,” in refusing to condense the long struggle of finding yourself into a catchy chorus, Liv.e affects an irresistibly magnetic anti-charm. She leads by example, by meeting herself in the present and holding her own gaze. Girl in the Half Pearl doesn’t fixate on the light at the end of the tunnel. It chisels into the rock slowly, humming along to the sound of each strike.",

        "notes" : "“‘Do the wrong thing’ is my thing,” TJ “Lil Silva” Carter tells Apple Music. “Because everyone thinks, ‘Oh, we've got to use this bassline, or do that sound.’ But actually, we should all strive to be in the now. What feels good, right now?” More than a decade on from his teen emergence in the UK’s Funky House scene, Lil Silva’s genre-bending odyssey lands here: a debut LP hosting a vigorous bout between ego and self-doubt. “It's all self work,” he says. \"But that’s important, because how much time do you want to invest in yourself? What do you want to unlock in your brain that you haven’t? How much are you worth?\" These questions arose for the producer, singer, songwriter and DJ throughout the course of deep meditation and Theta healing (an energy healing technique and spiritual philosophy), and lay central to his ongoing exploration of the self. Yesterday Is Heavy crafts a moving elegy that explores feelings of alienation (“Backwards”), raw emotion (“Another Sketch”) and disjointedness (“Still”) experienced throughout lockdown, and remedied in rich, experimental textures that draw on the sincerity of Silva’s bluesy vocals and arrangement style, plus some eclectic collaborations (including standout moments with Sampha and Little Dragon). “I’ve always been skeptical about being genre specific,” he says. \"I’ve always known that Lil Silva is going to be a sound. Yes, I’ve been influenced by Timberland, Pharrell, and even the early grime era of Davince, Plastician, Jon E Cash, Wiley. All have defining sounds. But I wasn’t listening to music for about two years when making this album. I was only going back in my archive, and bringing out what hadn’t seen the light of day.” Here, Lil Silva talks us through the 12 expansive tracks of his debut album, track by track. “Another Sketch” “I’m constantly inspired by the changing state of water. The idea that something can be, in real time, one thing, in the past something else, and in the future have a different existence, state or body. This song is about heritage, and moments in time, whether that’s in the past, present or future. So it’s about family, also.” “Be Cool” (with Little Dragon) “I started writing this song with [producer and multi-instrumentalist] Mansur Brown. He’s dangerous to be in a studio with because in between trying to finish a song, he'll play something crazy, I think we made five songs that day. His [guitar] playing is insane, and the way he's got his pedal game is a joke. He was playing this groove, and I done this whole beat around it. And after I wrote this song, I sent it over and [Little Dragon’s] Yukimi [Nagano] loved it. It really related to her, and she also added in a few things. I’d done some remix work with Little Dragon before, but we’d been itching to get a song of our own together.” “Vera (Judah Speaks)” “This track picks up from the tempo of the intro. I started with the drums off the top, working with [producer] Duncan Laurence, we did “Deja Vu” [on 2016 EP Jimi] together, and working with peope that I consider family on this album just felt right. We created this orchestral feel and had strings played by [composer and arranger] Sally Herbert. I’ve always known I’d have some strings on my album—and that goes back to my early tracks like [2008 single] “Seasons”, with the brass influence, I’m just pulling from that.” “Leave It” (with Charlotte Day Wilson) “This is a message about celebrating what’s right in front of you. There’s no need to worry, or at least don’t worry for too long. The clouds of doubts that hover over, in life, and sometimes in love feel like you’ll never move out of. But, however grey and however challenging, there’s a way to get through it. It’s too easy to get caught up in everything around you. “September” “There was a lot raw emotion in this. I was definitely feeling a lot of grit in that day, and it all came out in ‘September’. I was with James Vincent McMorrow and Benji B, and we’d clipped through this sample, and Benji played it for me at the perfect time. I was like: ‘Wow, I've never really put samples on my song before like this.’ So, it was paying homage to it I guess. James is dope, really dynamic, and always comes up with these crazy interesting melody trips. And Benji has done a lot. He’s the perfect guy to have in the room, for his energy, and knowledge of music, to radio, and fashion. It wouldn't have felt right if I didn't have the [club brand] Deviation family in-and-out of this, to bounce the energy off, because my music's gone from the club to here, and he's been a massive part of that.” “To The Floor” (with BADBADNOTGOOD) “It's in the title, man. Just get to it, basically. With BADBADNOTGOOD, we had this unconventional arrangement and it was about just pocketing those grooves, and the funk. This was one of the five, myself and Mansur had done, but I was like, man, this could definitely have an extra bit of funk—there's a groove that could be interesting here. So I played the idea to BADBADNOTGOOD, and they came through with: drums, guitar, and even some flutes!” “Backwards” (with Sampha) “This song touches on the feeling of alienation and constantly venting in the matrix you find yourself in, whatever that may be. Restricted and feeling guilty to move forward, constantly going backwards mentally; I guess the song is about being in a never ending cycle and the heaviness that can bring.” “What If? (with Skiifall)” “I really channeled inspiration from our roots on this record. You can hear the reggae, bashment and grime influence weave in and out. This track is about the course we find ourselves on, without even thinking. It’s about the huge role that love and family plays in our lives, but staying grounded and never forgetting what got us here.” “Colours” “I was coming into the studio shoot for about four or five days, I kept singing, ‘There's colours, colorus, colours’… it's like, why is this bugging me? It's every day, saying the same thing. It just kept trickling through my brain. And I made that into this beautiful soul thing, and eventually I switched it up. This bassline you could say comes from grime—but grime is in me. I used to be in [Bedford grime collective] Macabre Unit back in the day.” “About Us” (with Elmiene) “It was good for me to get back into my archive, it was like a massive soundboard for myself with sounds and work I could take. Across this process when I would have a block, I would just dig in my archive, as you would, it's almost like I'm going to remix one of my tracks that no one knows about this. It's all there.” “Still” (with Sampha & Ghetts) “We were all in the room jamming for around 30 minutes. And as I’ve dissected this beat—everyone behind me, they all loved this bassline. But I didn't like it. Just how familiar, or how close to familiar it was, so I flipped it and found the right bass. Then Sampha dropped the first line, and I knew he had to repeat it. It's so honest, man, it's just like, ‘Fuck, I still got all this shit to do’. And he just kept on flowing. And that was the thing: If it feels good to me now, we're going to do it now. This shit was lighting me up. Because if it's not lighting you up, why are you doing it?” “Ends Now” (with serpentwithfeet) “So we’re back to Mansur’s crazy licks. I breathed a vocal on this, and asked Serpent’ to try some vocals on it, and he fell in love. He just got it. Then he's taking my lyrics and putting them in places to sustain his vocal in moments, and pocket it differently. He’s also not trying to do the conventional thing, it’s all about what feels good.”",

        "notes" : "If The Smile ever seemed like a surprisingly upbeat name for a band containing two members of Radiohead (Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, joined by Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner), the trio used their debut gig to offer some clarification. Performing as part of Glastonbury Festival’s Live at Worthy Farm livestream in May 2021, Yorke announced, “We are called The Smile: not The Smile as in ‘Aaah!’—more the smile of the guy who lies to you every day.” To grasp the mood of their debut album, it’s instructive to go even deeper into a name that borrows the title of a 1970 Ted Hughes poem. In Hughes’ impressionist verse, some elemental force—compassion, humanity, love maybe—rises up to resist the deception and chicanery behind such disarming grins. And as much as the 13 songs on A Light for Attracting Attention sense crisis and dystopia looming, they also crackle with hope and insurrection. The pulsing electronics of opener “The Same” suggest the racing hearts and throbbing temples of our age of acute anxiety, and Yorke’s words feel like a call for unity and mobilisation: “We don’t need to fight\/Look towards the light\/Grab it in with both hands\/What you know is right.” Perennially contemplating the dynamics of power and thought, he surveys a world where “devastation has come” (“Speech Bubbles”) under the rule of “elected billionaires” (“The Opposite”), but it’s one where protest, however extreme, can still birth change (“The Smoke”). Amid scathing guitars and outbursts of free jazz, his invective zooms in on abuses of power (“You Will Never Work in Television Again”) before shaming inertia and blame-shifters on the scurrying beats and descending melodies of “A Hairdryer”. These aren’t exactly new themes for Yorke and it’s not a record that sits at an extreme outpost of Radiohead’s extended universe. Emboldened by Skinner’s fluid, intrepid rhythms, A Light for Attracting Attention draws frequently on various periods of Yorke and Greenwood’s past work. The emotional eloquence of Greenwood’s soundtrack projects resurfaces on “Speech Bubbles” and “Pana-Vision”, while Yorke’s fascination with digital reveries continues to be explored on “Open the Floodgates” and “The Same”. Elegantly cloaked in strings, “Free in the Knowledge” is a beautiful acoustic-guitar ballad in the lineage of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees” and the original live version of “True Love Waits”. Of course, lesser-trodden ground is visited, too: most intriguingly, math-rock (“Thin Thing”) and folk songs fit for a ’70s sci-fi drama (“Waving a White Flag”). The album closes with “Skrting on the Surface”, a song first aired at a 2009 show Yorke played with Atoms for Peace. With Greenwood’s guitar arpeggios and Yorke’s aching falsetto, it calls back even further to The Bends’ finale, “Street Spirit (Fade Out)”. However, its message about the fragility of existence—“When we realise we have only to die, then we’re out of here\/We’re just skirting on the surface”—remains sharply resonant.",

        "id" : "1655349115",
        "notes" : "Lana Del Rey has mastered the art of carefully constructed, high-concept alt-pop records that bask in—and steadily amplify—her own mythology; with each album we become more enamoured by, and yet less sure of, who she is. This is, of course, part of her magic and the source of much of her artistic power. Her records bid you to worry less about parsing fact from fiction and, instead, free-fall into her theatrical aesthetic—a mix of gloomy Americana, Laurel Canyon nostalgia and Hollywood noir that was once dismissed as calculation and is now revered as performance art. Up until now, these slippery, surrealist albums have made it difficult to separate artist from art. But on her introspective ninth album, something seems to shift: She appears to let us in a little. She appears to let down her guard. The opening track is called “The Grants”—a nod to her actual family name. Through unusually revealing, stream-of-conscious songs that feel like the most poetic voice notes you’ve ever heard, she chastises her siblings, wonders about marriage and imagines what might come with motherhood and midlife. “Do you want children?\/Do you wanna marry me?” she sings on “Sweet”. “Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?” This is relatively new lyrical territory for Del Rey, who has generally tended to steer around personal details, and the songs themselves feel looser and more off-the-cuff (they were mostly produced with long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff). It could be that Lana has finally decided to start peeling back a few layers, but for an artist whose entire catalogue is rooted in clever imagery, it’s best to leave room for imagination. The only clue might be in the album’s single piece of promo, a now-infamous billboard in Tulsa, Oklahoma, her ex-boyfriend’s hometown. She settled the point fairly quickly on Instagram. “It’s personal,” she wrote.",

On 2011’s Felt, he applied preparations to hammers and strings; in 2015, he founded Piano Day, a celebration of the instrument. But on Music for Animals, which follows 2021’s solo piano record Old Friends New Friends, Frahm closes the cover on his keyboard and, instead, busies himself with his studio full of vintage and analogue synthesisers. Begun during the first year of the pandemic, when the world pressed pause on daily life, it basks in an almost reverent sense of calm. Chords unfurl patiently against a backdrop of velvety reverb. There are few distractions and little harmonic development—just abiding quiet and sparkling focus. The pinging arpeggios of “Sheep in Black and White” recall the clockworks of Frahm’s live shows rendered in slow motion and zero gravity; the languid “Do Dream” drapes a wheezing pump organ in negative space. Three hours long and soft as a whisper, Music for Animals is a breathtakingly beautiful ode to stillness and solitude.",

        "notes" : "Like a lot of music made in the early 2020s, the electronic pop producer and dance music experimenter Kathy Yaeji Lee’s colourful, searching first official album was born in part out of the forced reckonings of the pandemic. “The prompt—which is what started the story—was my anger,” Yaeji tells Apple Music. “I’m stuck in my room. I have no distractions. Thoughts, memories, things I haven’t processed because I would distract myself usually—they started to come up. And for the first time, from all of that—from remembering childhood, from what was happening around us politically, socially—I felt deep anger, and I had no idea what to do with it. So I said, 'I have to make something. I have to write.'” But part of what makes the album interesting is Lee’s ability to frame that anger with sounds that feel inviting, even celebratory—a contrast that has the meditative effect of diffusing emotions even as she expresses them; or, put another way, to demonstrate curiosity about them instead of just venting them, whether it’s the panic of cyclic thinking (“For Granted”, “Done [Let’s Get It]”) or the discomfort of self-alienation (“Passed Me By”). “When I write, it’s to understand what happened better, to understand myself better,” she says. “And for that reason, in the moment, I’m not clocking what’s happening or exactly what it is I’m writing about. But then, after I’m done writing it, after I play it for a friend, after it comes out into the world—sometimes that’s when I realise or fully process the thing I was trying to figure out.” The feelings of With a Hammer are hot, but the music—spacious, patient, round, guided by Lee’s naturally diminutive voice—is cool. The project also offered Lee opportunities to discover new creative approaches. The flute that opens “Submerge FM”, for example, was one of many samples Lee collected from sessions with friends before she’d even started writing the album in earnest but whose role didn’t become clear until much later. “I just sat with this loop on forever and then I started improvising on my synth, and it became almost like this conversation or call-and-response. And that’s what started the first track on the album—me just having a conversation with Gabby [Gabrielle Garo].” (Similar conversations appear with a trumpet on “I’ll Remember for Me, I’ll Remember for You” and fractured percussion on “With a Hammer”.) She also managed to further explore not just her identity as a speaker of Korean and English, but the way both languages can dovetail with the abstractions of musical expression. “When I was writing ‘Passed Me By’, the main chorus of it isn’t even made up of lyrics, it’s just sound,” she says. “And the combination of the bass and the [’90s-style] synth…made me feel like I’m expressing a feeling I haven’t been able to say in words before.”",

The initials of the title of her soul-searching fourth LP spelled out her first name, and the name of its surprise follow-up also hints at a purposeful double meaning. Perhaps a kindly expression of gratitude for the flowers given since SIMBI’s success? More likely an act of defiance. Either way, within this trademark ambiguity Simz gets her shine on across 10 sumptuous tracks. BRIT Awards Producer Of The Year 2022 Dean Josiah Cover—aka Inflo—taps into the rich, bluesy elements of his enigmatic Sault music for urgent dispatches from Simbi Ajikawo. It’s a rich sonic seam: A returning undercurrent of gospel-rooted R&B reinforces lines with spiritual resonance. From tone-setting opener “Angel” (dedicated to the model Harry Uzoka, who died in January 2018), soft choral flourishes and dreamy Cleo Sol vocals help Simz pick up where she left off in 2021. “Revoke access, I’m running it back, yes\/Missing opportunities, I wish I was that pressed.” Building on a deep-rooted synergy, Simz and Inflo go the whole length on the gut feeling that has made their partnership so prolific. For Simz, an artist who’s always operated to her own set of standards, an equally clear-sighted collaborator (Inflo is also across the keys, chords and strings) finds her at her most compassionate and precise, tackling family trauma and the emotional isolation of success. Within the streams of sharp, self-analysing rhymes, scattered samples and prolonged orchestral sections—“Sideways” and “Control”—lies the sound of a winning combo firmly in the groove.

By facing down the dark reaches of the mind and the tests of her daily environment, emotional and soulful highs and lows are wonderfully bared across her tightest lyrical offering to date.",

        "artist" : "Young Fathers",
        "id" : "1647061933",
        "notes" : "Young Fathers occupy a unique place in British music. The Mercury Prize-winning trio are as adept at envelope-pushing sonic experimentalism and opaque lyrical impressionism as they are at soulful pop hooks and festival-primed choruses—frequently, in the space of the same song. Coming off the back of an extended hiatus following 2018’s acclaimed Cocoa Sugar, the Edinburgh threesome entered their basement studio with no grand plan for their fourth studio album other than to reconnect to the creative process, and each other. Little was explicitly discussed. Instead, Alloysious Massaquoi, Kayus Bankole and Graham “G” Hastings—all friends since their school days—intuitively reacted to a lyric, a piece of music or a beat that one of them had conceived to create multifaceted pieces of work that, for all their complexities and contradictions, hit home with soul-lifting, often spiritual, directness. Through the joyous clatter of opener “Rice”, the electro-glam battle cry “I Saw”, the epic “Tell Somebody” and the shape-shifting sonic explosion of closer “Be Your Lady”, Young Fathers express every peak and trough of the human condition within often-dense tapestries of sounds and words. “Each song serves an integral purpose to create something that feels cohesive,” says Bankole. “You can find joy in silence, you can find happiness in pain. You can find all these intricate feelings and diverse feelings that reflect reality in the best possible way within these songs.” Across 10 dazzling tracks, Heavy Heavy has all that and more, making it the band’s most fully realised and affecting work to date. Let Massaquoi and Bankole guide you through it, track by track. “Rice” Alloysious Massaquoi: “What we’re great at doing is attaching ourselves to what the feeling of the track is and then building from that, so the lyrics start to come from that point of view. [On ‘Rice’] that feeling of it being joyous was what we were connecting to. It was the feeling of fresh morning air. You’re on a journey, you’re moving towards something, it feels like you’re coming home to find it again. For me, it was finding that feeling of, ‘OK, I love music again,’ because during COVID it felt redundant to me. What mattered to me was looking after my family.” “I Saw” AM: “We’d been talking about Brexit, colonialism, about forgetting the contributions of other countries and nations so that was in the air. And when we attached ourselves to the feeling of the song, it had that call-to-arms feeling to it, it’s like a march.” Kayus Bankole: “It touches on Brexit, but it also touches on how effective turning a blind eye can be, that idea that there’s nothing really you can do. It’s a call to arms, but there’s also this massive question mark. I get super-buzzed by leaving question marks so you can engage in some form of conversation afterwards.” “Drum” AM: “It’s got that sort of gospel spiritual aspect to it. There’s an intensity in that. It’s almost like a sermon is happening.” KB: “The intensity of it is like a possession. A good, spiritual thing. For me, speaking in my native tongue [Yoruba] is like channelling a part of me that the Western world can’t express. I sometimes feel like the English language fails me, and in the Western world not a lot of people speak my language or understand what I’m saying, so it’s connecting to my true self and expressing myself in a true way.” “Tell Somebody” AM: “It was so big, so epic that we just needed to be direct. The lyrics had to be relatable. It’s about having that balance. You have to really boil it down and think, ‘What is it I’m trying to say here?’ You have 20 lines and you cut it down to just five and that’s what makes it powerful. I think it might mean something different to everyone in the group, but I know what it means to me, through my experiences, and that’s what I was channelling. The more you lean into yourself, the more relatable it is.” “Geronimo” AM: “It’s talking about relationships: ‘Being a son, brother, uncle, father figure\/I gotta survive and provide\/My mama said, “You’ll never ever please your woman\/But you’ll have a good time trying.”’ It’s relatable again, but then you have this nihilistic cynicism from Graham: ‘Nobody goes anywhere really\/Dressed up just to go in the dirt.’ It’s a bit nihilistic, but given the reality of the world and how things are, I think you need the balance of those things. Jump on, jump off. It’s like: decide. You’re either hot or you’re cold. Don’t be lukewarm. You either go for it or you don’t. Then encapsulating all that within Geronimo, this Native American hero.” “Shoot Me Down” AM: “‘Shoot Me Down’ is definitely steeped in humanity. You’ve got everything in there. You’ve got the insecurities, the cynicism, you’ve got the joy, the pain, the indifference. You’ve got all those things churning around in this cauldron. There’s a level of regret in there as well. Again, when you lean into yourself, it becomes more relatable to everybody else.” “Ululation” KB: “It’s the first time we’ve ever used anyone else on a track. A really close friend of mine, who I call a sister, called me while we were making ‘Uluation’: ‘I need a place to stay, I’m having a difficult time with my husband, I’m really angry at him…’ I said if you need a place to chill just come down to the studio and listen to us while we work but you mustn’t say a word because we’re working. We’re working on the track and she started humming in the background. Alloy picked up on it and was like, ‘Give her a mic!’ She’s singing about gratitude. In the midst of feeling very angry, feeling like shit and that life’s not fair, she still had that emotion that she can practise gratitude. I think that’s a beautiful contrast of emotions.” “Sink Or Swim” AM: “It says a similar thing to what we’re saying on ‘Geronimo’ but with more panache. The music has that feeling of a carousel, you’re jumping on and jumping off. If you watch Steve McQueen’s Small Axe [film anthology], in Lovers Rock, when they’re in the house party before the fire starts—this fits perfectly to that. It’s that intensity, the sweat and the smoke, but with these direct lines thrown in: ‘Oh baby, won’t you let me in?’ and ‘Don’t always have to be so deep’. Sometimes you need a bit of directness, you need to call a spade a spade.” “Holy Moly” AM: “It’s a contrast between light and dark. You’re forcing two things that don’t make sense together. You have a pop song and some weird beat, and you’re forcing them to have this conversation, to do something, and then ‘Holy Moly’ comes out of that. It’s two different worlds coming together and what cements it is the lyrics.” “Be Your Lady” KB: “It’s the perfect loop back to the first track so you could stay in the loop of the album for decades, centuries and millenniums and just bask in these intricate parts. ‘Be Your Lady’ is a nice wave goodbye, but it’s also radical as fuck. That last line ‘Can I take 10 pounds’ worth of loving out of the bank please?’ I’m repeating it and I’m switching the accents of it as well because I switch accents in conversation. I sometimes speak like someone who’s from Washington, D.C. [where Bankole has previously lived], or someone who’s lived in the Southside of Edinburgh, and I sometimes speak like someone who’s from Lagos in Nigeria.” AM: “I wasn’t convinced about that track initially. I was like, ‘What the fuck is this?’” KB: “That’s good, though. That’s the feeling that you want. That’s why I feel it’s radical. It’s something that only we can do, it comes together and it feels right.”",

        "id" : "1581498462",
        "notes" : "With an audience comes expectations—and Snail Mail’s Lindsey Jordan became acutely aware of both following the warm response to her 2018 debut LP Lush, released when she was only 18. “I was 100% terrified,” she tells Apple Music. “It’s so confusing to get any kind of reaction to your work. And I think it kept me from writing for at least a year, just because I was scared. I make music because I love it, so it was really all about connecting with—for lack of a better analogy—my child self.”\nMaking that connection was that much easier when Jordan found herself living with her parents again in suburban Maryland for five months, after the pandemic took hold in 2020. That’s where much of Valentine began to take shape, Jordan working alone in her childhood bedroom, free of distractions. Though bigger and bolder and more adventurous than its predecessor, the album is still deeply personal—indie rock that’s laced with reflections on time spent in and out of love and rehab. “Whether the actual time there was for better or for worse, it got good art out of me,” she says of being back home. “I just felt like I was just doing it for fun again, like when I was working on Lush, coming home from high school every day and writing for a while. I guess just sitting on that same carpet was pretty liberating for me.” Here, she guides us through the entire album, track by track.\n“Valentine” “I was shopping around ideas for the record long before there was one, just wanting to put a title to the thing to maybe give it a start—like if there's just an overarching vibe, then I can start to make things. It's such a heartbreaking thing, referring to someone as your valentine in a love-lost type of way, because I just think there's nothing more tender and innocent. I just think the hurt there is pretty relatable, and when I came up with ‘darling, valentine’, it kicked me in the guts in a way that felt right for the entire thing. I just knew immediately that the record was going to be called Valentine.”\n“Ben Franklin” “I've always been extremely self-assured, confident and independent—especially doing this job at such a young age. And rehab just kicks that out of you in a way. You kind of have to get in touch with values in a way that is shocking. Even just in the pandemic I was like, ‘Okay, so now I need to be good at being a normal person, too.’ And that's different, and that’s not something I was so self-assured in. It was a big decision to want to just go and clean up, so that I could work again. I'm not cocky anymore. I'm dealing with what I left behind. It’s like, boom: real adulthood.”\n“Headlock” “‘Headlock’ isn’t about losing someone so much as it is about really losing myself in a relationship. I worked on that one at my parents' house—all the synth lines I did in my room on my Minilogue, and I wrote all the lyrics sitting right there at my desk, just sort of dipping my toes into the deep darkness. With that line ‘Thought I'd see her when I died,’ I'm saying that the end goal of dying in this case would be to be reunited with this lost love. It came from a real dark spot that I was in.”\n“Light Blue” “I wrote it for a girlfriend. It feels like I was young at the time—I was 19—and even though it wasn't that long ago, in a way it was. I guess I meant it to be a gesture, but also kind of a declaration. I don't remember it being a particular communicative relationship but it was fiery and I think that was my way of communicating my feelings at the time—and I think that comes through.”\n“Forever (Sailing)” “That song was initially constructed from a sample of a song, ‘You and I’ by Madleen Kane. I heard it forever ago and I was just really moved—it has some magic that feels like I really feel. And I had never really dabbled in sampling, but I just couldn't stop thinking about being involved with the song somehow, selfishly. So I brought it to the studio in North Carolina and we isolated the sample and slowed it down. It's kind of a deep cut in a way, and random that I heard it. I don't know that much about disco at all.”\n“Madonna” “I was raised Catholic and went to Sunday school. I was in the church band. And the song is about putting someone on a pedestal and worshiping them and how that just doesn't translate into anything but resentment and anger once you kind of step away from it. Using religious metaphors and my knowledge from that time of my life felt exciting and genuine. I have a deep fear of being blasphemous—I don't want to disappoint my mom.”\n“c. Et Al.” “I spent a lot of time writing it in the van, actually, on tour. I had a little portable amp that hooks up to headphones and I would just play it in there because I don't like to come up with lyrics around other people. It's complex, because I’d be sitting in the van for eight hours a day or something.”\n“Glory” “Very angry and upset vibes. And it's similar thematically to ‘Madonna’, goes within the same grieving process and theme of anger. It's disenchanted as fuck. It’s like no matter how angry I am and no matter how much I try to make this something where I'm in control and I'm the one making demands, at the end of the day I still would do anything for the subject of the song. No matter how in control I feel, I don't even feel like I belong to myself because I'm so entwined in this person's life.”\n“Automate” “I think that there comes a time when—through experience and through fucking up and learning about my needs and myself—love becomes less of a fantasy and less of a game. There’s so much that needs to exist for love to be healthy, and once you realise that relationships are more than what you imagined them to be as a teenager and as a kid, it just becomes a lot more loaded. Like love, real love, is unconditional in a perfect world, and it's loving somebody beyond the good stuff. Being in love with someone is taking them where they're at and having them take you where you're at, and that's the brutal truth being uncovered in that song: It’s not all about passion and fire.”\n“Mia” “‘Mia’ is the only song with a full orchestra on it and the whole shebang. Originally, we sent the song to an arranger and they sent back some ideas. I wasn't crazy about the arrangement, so I played some of the arrangement myself on a synth and sent it back and was like, ‘Can I hear this?’ That synth line that got translated into an orchestral moment is one of my favourite parts of the song—it was super collaborative.”",

A quasi-concept album that seems to have something to do with war (“Welcome to Hell”, “27 Questions”), or at least the violence men do more generally (“Sugar\/Tzu”, “Dangerous Liaisons”), Hellfire isn’t an easy listen. But it’s funny (main character: Tristan Bongo), beautiful, at least in a garish, misanthropic way (the Neil Diamond bombast of “The Defence”), and so obviously playful in its intelligence that you just want to let it run over you. The first listen feels like being yelled at in a language you don’t understand. By the third, you’ll be yelling with them.",

        "notes" : "From Pitchfork:\n\n“Rachika Nayar doesn’t just spew out a little fog before her live show, she stretches the venue’s fire code to its limit. Before the guitarist walks onstage, the entire performance space is clouded, red exit signs barely visible, until you can barely see your hand in front of your face. The effect on the audience is immediate: Conversations dull to a whisper and friends drift carefully towards each other to reunite before the music starts, tiptoeing across a shadowy maze of bodies as they take on a heightened awareness of their own.\n\nIt’s the perfect environment to experience Nayar’s music. Interviewed on the heels of her 2021 debut, Our Hands Against the Dusk, she championed the “totally obliterating” power of a rave’s atmosphere, and spoke of her desire to create a similar environment, ones that “simultaneously takes you out of yourself, and submerges you deep within yourself.” Our Hands did this by constructing misty ambient labyrinths out of processed guitar, revealing Nayar’s ability to sculpt the instrument’s earthy twang into unpredictable alien timbres and shift them back to familiar shapes at a moment’s notice. When Nayar debuted tracks from her astonishing second album, Heaven Come Crashing, at the Brooklyn venue Public Records, strobes flashed violently and unexpected floods of drums crashed into the crowd. Egos melted away as the crowd breathed in a wave of ecstatic release.\n\nHeaven Come Crashing injects the ambient wash of Nayar’s past work with flashes of dancefloor emotionality, striking a balance between reflective contemplation and the ego-melting thrills of a warehouse party. On the stunning title track, she traces the arc of her musical transformation in miniature. Slices of granulated guitar gently refract into the frame, and for a few seconds, the song could be a holdover from the swooning sentimentality of Our Hands. But she soldiers on, backed by unearthly guest vocals from fellow guitarist and songwriter Maria BC that swell from airy wisps into a supercharged choir. Suddenly, a trap door unhinges and you’re ripped into a punishingly beautiful beat drop. It’s a scene of catharsis surrounded by a squealing guitar solo and the cascading cymbal crashes of a drum’n’bass beat. “Heaven Come Crashing” lifts you up with shameless melodrama and pure affirmation: It was all worth it.\n\nNayar deploys these moments of tension and release with the sixth sense of a veteran after-hours DJ, keenly aware that floor-filling emotional highs are earned through careful pacing. “Tetramorph,” the album’s longest and most satisfying song, weaves through a series of false stops and starts that perfectly read the pulse of the crowd. Chattering hi-hats come in at full volume, emerging from pin-drop silence in a quick hit of stimulation. They fizzle out but the effects cling to your body, propping you up as you navigate a maze of buzzing drones that build into a waltzing post-rock climax. The effect is startling, but as Nayar rocks out in the coda, you easily recall every part of the meticulously arranged journey, awe-struck at how seamlessly she blended it all together.\n\nOther tracks use compositional sleight-of-hand to leave you dangling off the edge of a cliff, ending on deliciously maddening chords that make you lean into the speaker, trying to manifest a neat resolution by sheer force of imagination. “The Price of Serenity” rides dueling motifs—a steadily rising clean piano arpeggio and a squelching synthesizer lead—to a crunchy four-on-the-floor stomp, disguising a jarring left turn into oblivion with a pulse-pounding bass drum stutter. In a show of supreme confidence, she resurrects the formula on the next track, “Our Wretched Fate,” crashing from nocturnal ecstasy into sober daylight in half the time. Unexpected power surges back into your feet, only for the house lights to come up.\n\nIn this metamorphosis from ambient composer to dancefloor mystic, Nayar meets her mirror image in UK producer Loraine James. Where Nayar has folded her impressionistic collages into body-breaking narrative arcs, James has done the opposite, smoothing out the gritty IDM of 2021’s Reflection to reemerge this year with ambient side-project Whatever the Weather. But although they take new form, traces of the past and beloved compositional tools linger. Just as James can’t help but blow the dust off her drum machine, Nayar uses her guitar for soothing interludes that provide a dynamic counterpoint to Heaven Come Crashing’s barn-burning anthems.\n\nNayar’s new guitar experiments light the path with flickering details. A rhythm that sounds as if it were tapped out on her thigh, off-the-cuff, gives “Gayatri” a strange kind of propulsion. And the combination of bass synth and the brief glimmer of a corresponding lead line roots the searching motif of “Death & Limerence” in the assurance of a heaven-bound trajectory. It’s a dazzling recalibration, lifting Nayar up and over the darkness of her previous work. The answers aren’t quite pieced together, but the questions grow deeper and more satisfying.”\n\nAfter seven weeks, number one again as it is such an interesting ambient album.",

        "notes" : "Especially the remixes are of great fun. What to think of Radio (Sinkane Remix). Almost minimal music. \nI have been listening to the original record and what a blast that is. Tracks like Radio, Etoh, Frontier Psychiatrist all mixed together using 900+ samples (truth is still out there); it is just phenomenal. Although this collection is about albums in 2021, this anniversary deluxe edition deserves a place in the charts.\n\nFrom spectrumculture.com:\n\nDo you remember a time before mashups? Before Danger Mouse made a name for himself splicing together Jay Z’s The Black Album and the Beatles’ The White Album, or biomed engineer Gregg Gillis catapulting the genre into a world of nonstop blends of Biggie Smalls and Elton John or Birdman and Temple of the Dog? Before you could, essentially, type two similar songs into YouTube to discover that somebody cooked up the “Head Like a Hole”\/”Call Me Maybe” mashup you imagined in your head? We won’t pretend that the Avalanches invented doing this around the dawn of the new millennium — to do so would ignore the Negativlands of the world, they of a strong lineage of splicers and visionaries who were doing things the hard way, without the help of Audacity or GarageBand or whatever program they chose to do it in.\n\nAnd maybe it’s disingenuous to even label Australia’s the Avalanches a “mashup band” — one might argue that what they do is plunderphonics, a term that sounds like your coolest uncle attempting to make up a word for, essentially, the same thing. It doesn’t matter what you call it, though. In a worst-case scenario, you might produce an unlistenable mess of incongruous sounds that you’d never foist on your worst enemy. But in the best-case — which is where we find ourselves with Since I Left You — you’ll find yourself immersed in a rich, shimmering tapestry of sounds and sensations that leave you wondering, “Now, how the fuck did they do that?”\n\nThese questions are the fairest ones to ask of any album this side of Paul’s Boutique. How did the Avalanches do that, and how the fuck did they get away with it? The actual number of samples contained within the hourlong journey of Since I Left You — now re-released in a gargantuan 4LP format to celebrate its 20th(!) anniversary — is difficult to pin down. While some estimate that the number sits within the 900 range, Robbie Chater (one of the two founding members still with the group to this day) puts it somewhere in the 3,500 range. For those that somehow missed Since I Left You, the fact that there’s a dispute over whether or not the album only contains 900 samples should give you an idea of the magical beast we’re working with here.\n\nThis article\/love letter could be double in size if we covered the spiraling galaxy of removals and revisions that have taken place over the years; because the band never really foresaw anyone listening to the album, much less anyone giving it distribution outside of Australia, the matter of clearance becomes murky and impossible. That lack of foresight means that they did a ludicrously bad job of even cataloguing the samples they used and tossed in some biggies just for kicks — and as such, some sacrifices to the Clearance Gods had to be made in order to introduce the rest of the world to the record. It’s entirely possible that you’ve only heard the version of “Frontier Psychiatrist” with vocals re-recorded in-house, and you may not have heard any clips from the film Midnight Run in the mix.\n\nUnderneath the dizzying number of samples and different versions of Since I Left You, though, there’s this album. It never truly feels like a real “album” — many songs here present themselves more as connective tissue between bigger set pieces. If Since I Left You is the ultimate summer party captured by thousands of sound fragments, these moments are like hallways full of different conversations within the microparties that can bloom in those events. You’d expect it to feel disjointed, even disorienting, right? But no — even when they’re sampling the shit out of horses neighing, Since I Left You is a fully fleshed-out world, and one that feels staggeringly visual; Wildflower and We Will Always Love You would show the Avalanches expanding their ability to construct remarkably vivid albums that induce temporary synesthesia, urging you to hear the music in colors and shapes and whole vistas, but what becomes clear as time goes on is that they more or less arrived fully capable of performing this magic trick, immediately capable of invoking technicolor worlds you yearn to live in. They don’t even need hits to keep you stoked — take a look at the beloved “Frontier Psychiatrist,” which moves away from the “song” part of the song long before the track itself ends, but totally organically.\n\nEven given 20 years to spend with Since I Left You, it’s hard to put a finger on what it is about these songs that endures like it does. From a certain view, the album can seem like amorphous noise that occasionally coalesces into a real “song.” This feels myopic, though. The fact that the album is so easily equated to a party points to the fact that the album doesn’t always feel like it was meant to serve as proper music, but instead, an aural gateway into your most fond memories. It’s a dreamworld dense with sounds that you feel like you must have heard somewhere, and just when you think you’ve caught it, the sound passes. Every sound in the world might be totally new to you, but when you’re hit with so many different things, it can create a strange phantom nostalgia for a formative experience that you never actually had. Songs like “Extra Kings” don’t need to have cohesive structure for it to do to you what it wants to do — the Avalanches are powerful wizards, and they can give you those moments even without it.\n\nWe’d be remiss if we didn’t go into the second half of this set. This massive 4LP reissue devotes two of those LPs to various remixes and (in the case of “Thank You Caroline,” seen in its infancy at the tail end) alternate versions of album tracks. The very nature of the record lends itself to those remixes — artists like Stereolab, Black Dice, Deakin, and the late MF Doom tear the songs apart easily, inserting themselves into these worlds effortlessly. Your enjoyment in this aspect may vary: if you come to the Avalanches to spend your time within the world they designed, you may find these remixes unnecessary. After all, doesn’t some of the magic of Since I Left You fade when you subject it to the standards of more typical dance music? Yet, for those willing to see what parts of each song are adopted and repurposed by each song’s rebuilder. This is true of all remixes, but the album is such a treasure trove of sights and sounds, and each remix sneakily represents a love letter from the artist about the moments during that grand party that stuck in their minds the most.\n\nThe remixes here run the gamut, like the propulsive, gargantuan Carl Craig’s Paperclip People Remix of “A Different Feeling,” or Sun Araw’s psychedelic take on “Close to You.” The most perplexing omission is the eternal barnburner “Stay Another Season,” but we do get Black Dice’s thoroughly Black Dice-y spin on “Summer Crane,” which sees the band throwing the original into a blender with plenty of classic noise they’ve had sitting around, and then recording the sound of that blender on Max. This song is destined to be polarizing as hell, but it’s easily the most unique track of the bunch (next to Deakin’s zonked “Extra Kings,” that is). And then there’s the two sets of triplets: “Since I Left You” and, most surprisingly, “Tonight May Have to Last Me All My Life” each get a trio of different remixes, allowing us to compare and contrast. Watch as Cornelius steals the vocal hook of “Since I Left You” and lovingly sews it into a shimmering sea of beats, Prince Paul cranks the funkiness and Stereolab reveals how easily the song fits into their French futurist aesthetic. “Tonight May Have to Last Me All My Life,” while existing squarely in the category of songs that feel representative of the space in between bigger set pieces, reveals itself as being highly remixable. Edan and MF Doom both choose to rap over the track, but the Dragged by Leon Vynehall version reconfigures the song into a bona fide dubstep banger worthy of a FactMag mix by Joy Orbison or Four Tet.\n\nTwenty years on, the legacy of the Avalanches is a confusing one full of letdowns (the 16-year wait for its follow up) and triumphs (their follow-ups, Wildflower and We Will Always Love You, each a surprising and distinct masterpiece in their own ways), but as they broaden their scope and creation methods, their talent feels unassailable. The worst thing about their remarkable and unassuming debut is also one of the best things: it’s an album that presents sounds that aren’t always musical or even listenable when not in context, an aspect which then asks you to exist within its curious world instead of simply dipping your toe into certain moments. Since I Left You is still a breath of fresh air after two decades, its heady trajectory providing endless revisits and the constant discovery of new, exciting aspects. Ultimately, labeling the band anything at all is a gross misunderstanding of what makes the Avalanches special in the first place. They were — and are — just a band transforming the sounds they love into sounds they know we’ll love, and that pursuit exists beyond any boxes we might try to put them in.",

        "notes" : "When Kendrick Lamar popped up on two tracks from Baby Keem’s The Melodic Blue (“range brothers” and “family ties”), it felt like one of hip-hop’s prophets had descended a mountain to deliver scripture. His verses were stellar, to be sure, but it also just felt like way too much time had passed since we’d heard his voice. He’d helmed 2018’s Black Panther compilation\/soundtrack, but his last proper release was 2017’s DAMN. That kind of scarcity in hip-hop can only serve to deify an artist as beloved as Lamar. But if the Compton MC is broadcasting anything across his fifth proper album Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, it’s that he’s only human. The project is split into two parts, each comprising nine songs, all of which serve to illuminate Lamar’s continually evolving world view. Central to Lamar’s thesis is accountability. The MC has painstakingly itemised his shortcomings, assessing his relationships with money (“United in Grief”), white women (“Worldwide Steppers”), his father (“Father Time”), the limits of his loyalty (“Rich Spirit”), love in the context of heteronormative relationships (“We Cry Together”, “Purple Hearts”), motivation (“Count Me Out”), responsibility (“Crown”), gender (“Auntie Diaries”) and generational trauma (“Mother I Sober”). It’s a dense and heavy listen. But just as sure as Kendrick Lamar is human like the rest of us, he’s also a Pulitzer Prize winner, one of the most thoughtful MCs alive and someone whose honesty across Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers could help us understand why any of us are the way we are.",

        "notes" : "Ever since 2013, when Sons of Kemet saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings first leapt onstage to join synth-and-drums duo Soccer96 in a spontaneous explosion of pure groove, the three musicians have been honing their gale-force attack. Dubbed The Comet Is Coming, the trio—Hutchings, drummer Max Hallett and synth player Dan Leavers—first laid out their double-barrelled jazz-dance fusion on 2016’s Channel the Spirits, then gave free rein to more psychedelic urges on 2019’s Trust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery and The Afterlife, which followed six months later. With Hyper-Dimensional Expansion Beam, The Comet Is Coming deliver their biggest, most expansive record yet. Part of that might stem from recording at Peter Gabriel’s Real World Studios, where the three musicians tracked four days of improv sessions that Hallett and Leavers subsequently reworked into these 11 powerhouse jams. In contrast to the previous two albums’ star-gazing tendencies, Hyper-Dimensional Expansion Beam unleashes a focused blast of energy with the opening “CODE”, with Hutchings meting out stabbing arpeggios over the rhythm section’s heads-down stomp. They expand their range with every track. “TECHNICOLOUR” is a slinky detour into liquid funk, and “LUCID DREAMER” drifts on a cloud of ambient soul; album highlight “PYRAMIDS” taps the tunnel-vision intensity of early-2000s techno. “ATOMIC WAVE DANCE” is another big one, with spiky sax riffs set against jagged arpeggios and a driving 4\/4 beat, while on “AFTERMATH”, they pursue krautrock down an almost ambient path. And listeners pining for the last albums’ offworld vibes will find an escape pod in the form of “ANGEL OF DARKNESS”, an unrestrained journey to their cosmic-jazz limits. The Comet Is Coming have never sounded tighter—or freer—than they do here.",

        "notes" : "When Jessie Ware wrote “Remember Where You Are”—the final song on her career-altering 2020 record What’s Your Pleasure?—she knew she’d unlocked the sound of her future. “I think I finally understood my place in music,” she tells Apple Music. “I felt like I was combining all my loves, from musical theatre to soul, groove, dance and funk to R&B and orchestral moments and group vocals. I wanted to do ‘Remember Where You Are’, but with a big old dance beat.” That’s more or less what you can expect from That! Feels Good!, on which the London singer-songwriter doubles down on her devotion the dance floor and—after the varnished opulence of What’s Your Pleasure?—embraces a looser, louder, more live sound. It’s (almost) all up, with brass and string arrangements, choruses of voices, very winking lyrics and, perhaps most surprisingly, rapping à la Blondie or Tom Tom Club. “My voice was always the thing, which is fabulous,” says Ware (who, of course, also belts out plenty of elastic vocals here). “But for me it was like, ‘Let’s see what else I’ve got.’” Made with …Pleasure collaborators James Ford, Clarence Coffee Jr., Shungudzo and Danny Parker, plus UK producer Stuart Price (Madonna, Kylie Minogue, The Killers, Pet Shop Boys), That! Feels Good! was powered by the roaring success of its predecessor. Released during the pandemic, the disco-fuelled What’s Your Pleasure? became an antidote for many during lockdown, and earned Ware a British Album of the Year BRIT Award nomination, a support slot on tour with Harry Styles and an army of new fans. All of which gave her the confidence to just keep having fun. “I felt like I’d been granted permission to let loose and show all sides of myself,” says Ware. “I wanted it to feel free, and I think that was indicative of how I was feeling. This record was about celebration and joy. I wanted it to feel like the sexiest slap around the face.” Read on as Ware walks us through That! Feels Good!, one song at a time. “That! Feels Good!” “I needed it to feel like you landed straight into a groove, which is very different to how I started What’s Your Pleasure?. It felt like I was imagining me as D’Angelo or James Brown. With the spoken thing at the start of this track, I’d said to [producer] James Ford, ‘Let’s really enjoy this intro: What do you think about [including] loads of different people so it felt like were in an orgy?’ It was about making people feel slightly uncomfortable, particularly British people, and to make you go, ‘Hang on, what is she about to do?’ Those voices are Roísín Murphy, Kylie Minogue, Aisling Bea, Jamie Demetriou, Gemma Arterton, benny blanco, my mum [Lennie Ware; Jessie’s co-host on their podcast Table Manners), my [podcast] producer Alice and her husband, who speak French, because they sounded really good, an ex-boyfriend who’s Spanish and Clara Amfo. We got them all!” “Free Yourself” “We nearly didn’t write this song. It was the first day I’d worked with Stuart [Price], and he’d played this house song but I felt it was a bit too close to What’s Your Pleasure?. Respect to Stuart, because he never gives up and said, ‘Can we just listen to that instrumental again?’ We put the vocal down just to see what happened and then Coffee [London-based songwriter and producer Clarence Coffee Jr.] sang, ‘Free yourself’—and it was really fun. Me and Coffee went and celebrated after—we had tequila and toasted the song because it felt like it was going to change things.” “Pearls” “It felt very camp and soulful, immediate, bombastic, glorious and fun. It’s saying, ‘Here are some of the ladies I’m going to be on this record.’ The lyric ‘And I do what I wanna\/A perfect prima donna’ is said with a wink because I know that I can play up to the role of being a pop star when I need to, but I never take myself too seriously. And when I say prima donna, it’s very much playing with the notion of women being thought of a certain way when they have an opinion, but also acknowledging that I am quite perfect at being a bit of a diva. Hopefully I don’t do it for too long!” “Hello Love” “I needed there to be a breather because I didn’t want people to feel exhausted by those first three songs, which are supposed to hit hard and feel like a bang. I hope this song lives on forever, because it feels quintessentially me, but with me having grown with experience in writing. It’s me tapping into romance and Donny Hathaway and soul music and groove like The Gap Band. I’m a sucker for a love song, but I wanted to do one that didn’t feel like a ballad per se. I also kind of wanted this to feel like the opportunity for a new first-dance song [at weddings], because I feel like everyone’s been using ‘Champagne Kisses’ and ‘Say You Love Me’, but they’re both really sad songs so they should just give up on those and do this one.” “Begin Again” “‘Begin Again’ is the pathway from What’s Your Pleasure? into That! Feels Good!. It’s where this album started—and was written over Zoom between LA and Hackney. The lyric ‘Why does all the purest love get filtered through machines?’ probably came from that—I’m sick to death of Zooms! But if you think further into it, it’s about being a prisoner to screens and it becoming so habitual and wanting to escape that, but not being able to. It was very much inspired by Stevie Wonder’s ‘Another Star’ and Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense, and bossa nova, Brazilian disco and longing for travel.” “Beautiful People” “I wanted this song to feel like it went from a monologue into a conversation. That there was a bit of a narrative, however fantasy-led that was. You go from talking yourself out of a crap day to going to a club and feeling free and happy. I think that’s what dance music, particularly going clubbing, can be, and I love that feeling—there’s nothing greater. But as a mother of three, who also works insanely hard, clubbing isn’t on the agenda every week. This was my way of transporting myself to that place.” “Freak Me Now” “Stuart made this instrumental and he was adamant that we were going to use it. This song has kind of French house nods and I was thinking about how Róisín Murphy would say something, as well as Mousse T.’s ‘Horny’ and Gwen McCrae’s ‘Keep the Fire Burning’. It’s another commanding song like ‘Free Yourself’ and I’m in the driver’s seat—it’s not requesting, it’s like this person’s going to have to do it. That was a really fun position to be in.” “Shake the Bottle” “This is almost my cabaret song. It’s highly camp and it’s me as a ‘madame’ and is just really fun. It was like, ‘How far can we push this innuendo?’ It feels more like a performance piece. I really hope all my queens that lip-sync like this, because I think I made it for lip-syncers. I’m in awe of the performance and I so respect drag and the creativity and the confidence. I feel so loved and cherished by a beautiful community and they’re always in my mind, particularly because we have so much fun together. I feel very lucky to have an incredibly strong following from the LGBTQ community. They’ve made me a better performer.” “Lightning” “I was definitely leaning into a more R&B moment: This pulled from Sade, Madlib, Drake. There needed to be a bit of space on the record to just take a moment, but I also wanted to feel like it could connect with the rest of the album. This is my husband’s favourite tune: it’s sex, it’s languid, it’s a bit of a breather. Maybe it’s also the end of the night when the party is starting to die out and it’s just you and somebody else. It has a vulnerability.” “These Lips” “I wanted it to feel like there was Earth, Wind & Fire on this, or Minnie Riperton. It felt right to finish with this spoken-word thing at the end, which is me trying to do my little Gil Scott-Heron moment. But it’s also got the celebratory and dramatic backing vocals. It felt optimistic, and like the groove carried on, but there’s also ceremony and drama—that’s how I wanted to leave people. It felt like a blissful, sensual ending.”",

From there, things just get more unpredictable: The shuddering beats of “Fiera” and “Ripples” feel like they’re coming apart at the seams, while the shimmering melody of “Skullqueen” channels mid-’90s Aphex Twin, long a latent influence on Arca’s fractured syncopations. But the storm clouds part for the closing “Joya”: Over soft, feathery chimes, she sings sweetly, “I want to tell you\/You are a jewel among men\/I feel so much love.” After so much violent turmoil, to let us down so gently feels like an act of kindness.",

        "artist" : "Special Interest",
        "id" : "1638180496",
        "notes" : "From Pitchfork:\n\n“On their remarkable third album, the New Orleans band pushes their sound to both its bleakest and its sweetest brinks. Pop, disco, and house all melt into their raucous, revolutionary glam punk.\n\nIn a big enough mosh pit, the world jostles loose. You enter the pit as one person, and you leave as someone else. The late queer theorist José Esteban Muñoz described this transformation as a portal in his 2009 book Cruising Utopia. “I remember the sexually ambiguous punk clubs of my youth where horny drunk punk boys rehearsed their identities, aggressively dancing with one another and later lurching out, intoxicated, to the parking lot together,” he wrote. “For many of them, the mosh pit was not simply a closet; it was a utopian subcultural rehearsal space.” In the squall of the music, reality starts to split and curl. Through communal, friendly violence, punks build muscle memory of what it’s like to feel unhinged and cared for at the same time. The thrash of bodies clears a channel, however fleeting, into a more survivable life.\n\nSpecial Interest drill down into that same molten core. Across three ferocious albums, the New Orleans band traces the line where the thirst for a new world meets the rage that torches the old one. Lit up and led by searingly charismatic singer Alli Logout, they call out the stakes of the era as they see them, excoriating gentrifiers, cops, warmongers, and trust-fund art-school kids with keenly tuned sneers. Songs about bracing for revolution brush up against songs about great sex on great drugs. Running on the tireless engine of Ruth Mascelli’s clattering drum machine, they follow in a legacy of queer perturbations from the ’80s and ’90s that include Coil, Frankie Knuckles, and the B-52’s—all of whom, in their own way, worked with the same mix of political dissatisfaction, biting humor, and erotic fantasy. On their third album, Endure, Special Interest push their sound to both its bleakest and its sweetest brinks. Pop, disco, and house all melt into their reliably raucous glam punk, and questions of communal caretaking press against a grief-riddled apocalyptic outlook. This time around, their thorns drip with honey.\n\nAcross Endure, Special Interest embellish the cornerstones they established on 2018’s Spiralling and 2020’s The Passion Of with gestures that wouldn’t sound out of place on ’90s radio. The after-dark sounds of house and techno started spilling onto commercial daytime airwaves toward the end of the last millennium, many of them drifting onto the Top 40 from overseas in the pan-flash genre called Eurodance. Logout stretches into certain vocal timbres and minor-key intervals that echo the perfect, ephemeral dance pop of a group like La Bouche, while behind their voice, delicate piano lines fringe the band’s hard-driving foundation. These shifts clear more air around Special Interest’s sound. While certain moments still feel immediate and unignorable, others seem to waft out from a club’s open back door, beckoning passersby to come take a closer look.\n\nThe album’s most compelling songs use both strategies in tandem. They invite you to wander in of your own accord, then enclose you inside a fever pitch. On the rollicking dance track “(Herman’s) House,” Special Interest forge an incandescent call to anger out of a surging hook. The song shares its name with a 2012 documentary about the imaginative collaboration between artist Jackie Sumell and activist Herman Wallace, a member of the Black Panther Party who spent 41 years in solitary confinement after serving a life sentence for a murder he denied committing. From his tiny cell, Wallace described his dream house to Sumell, who rendered it via computer graphics and as a tabletop model. In 2013, Wallace finally stepped out of prison, then died of cancer three days later. Sumell made plans to build the house he described to her as a youth community center in New Orleans, but property developers bought the proposed land out from under her.\n\nThe story ends bitterly, but Special Interest find solace in the idea of projecting utopia out from hell. “Build it out like Herman’s house,” Logout screams at the chorus over Nathan Cassiani’s jaw-clenched bassline. “We’ll all be Basquiats for five minutes or Hermans for life\/So when I say build I mean dream, because that’s all we got promised,” they command in a spoken-word breakdown just before the final refrain. In a recent Quietus interview, Logout illuminated the juxtaposition between the Black queer artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and Wallace: “It’s two different sides of what being Black in America is. You’re either fully idolized and destroyed, or you’re thrown in a cage.”\n\nSpecial Interest began writing Endure in the middle of 2020, in the wake of uprisings against police killings that stirred cities around the world. Across the insistent drumbeat spikes of “Concerning Peace,” the band bemoans the whittling down of those revolutionary impulses into a neoliberal mold of nonviolent personal enrichment: “Liberal erasure of militant uprising is a tool of corporate interest and a failure of imagination,” goes a call-out line reminiscent of the interjections on System of a Down’s “Prison Song.” Over Maria Elena’s frothing, sidelong guitar chords, the band’s voices come together for the chant-along chorus, where they collectively quote the Black Power activist Stokely Carmichael: “We are not concerned with peace\/Peace is not of our concern.” Power disguises its own violence as the natural order of things; to call for violence in retaliation clarifies the terms of a smiling oppressor. “No one will ever rest in peace\/When their value is less than property,” Logout seethes, pillorying commentators who expressed more concern over broken store windows than the lives of Black people killed by police.\n\nEndure howls against a capitalist regime that feeds on the neglect and death of sidelined and exploited human beings, both in the U.S. and globally. This system is fragmented enough to work in the shadows; long threads connect military activity in the Middle East and the gas that seeps out of the pump at the 7-Eleven, but they’re obscured enough that whoever’s gripping the handle won’t typically feel them. On “Kurdish Radio,” Special Interest draw an explicit line between oil lurking under the sands of contested territory and the lives lived in American cities. “Is love like Arab oil?\/Do we take take take till it’s depleted?” Logout sings. Later in the song, they overlay crude oil with blood staining the streets of New Orleans, as if to suggest that connecting local struggle to a global network makes for a start. At the climax of “Concerning Peace,” Logout calls out the names of metropolises across the world, tethering them together as sites of both historic disinvestment and revolutionary potential.\n\nAmid calls to destroy every kind of cage, Special Interest stay attuned to what might sprout from the ashes. The music video for “Midnight Legend,” a sweetly melodic dance track whose single version features a verse from Mykki Blanco, follows a group of clubgoers through a messy night out. They flip off a handsy bouncer, ingest a few too many drugs, argue with exasperated bartenders, and get kicked out of the bathroom in the middle of a gay threesome. This club houses little of the utopia the dancefloor can sometimes tease; all night, it plays host to low-grade, aggravating conflict. Then the dancers spill out into the morning light. As passersby hustle their way to work, three of the clubgoers sync up for an impromptu dance routine. The people who have just woken up scowl at those who have been up all night. But the dancers look at each other and beam. Their movements reassure each other that they have each other’s backs even if no one else does. Under the new sun, they practice another world inside the cracks of this one.\n\nThe album rolls to a close with the slow-burning “LA Blues,” a song that sheds its skin multiple times over the course of its eight minutes. It starts with a handful of neighborhood scenes and a repeated falsetto taunt: “If you don’t like it you can fuck right off\/Them boys in blue don’t come around on this block.” In the third verse, Logout’s gaze turns inward. They ruminate on the end of a relationship, approaching a state of tenderness but quickly diverting it with a sarcastic “boo hoo,” then looping back to the bitterly laughing chorus. But as the song rolls on, as the one-two step of the drumbeat and the guitar’s sour roar refuse to slow or pause, Logout dives deeper. The song boils into a dirge; Logout interrogates God in the wake of an immeasurable loss, their voice strained and cracking. As they hold their grief in its fullness, the song changes again, turning anthem-like, and Logout parts the curtains on a formerly hidden outlook. “The end of the world is just a destination\/I had to grow to love\/Yes and now I know I’m not unworthy of love,” they conclude, their voice warm and open, defenses scattered on the ground. If this world is barrelling toward a cliff, if there’s an unavoidable terminus square in our path, maybe we should try to love like we did at the beginning.” \n",

        "id" : "1590412236",
        "notes" : "In the context of Nilüfer Yanya’s second album, the word “painless” has a few different meanings. “I was enjoying the process of making the record, and thinking, ‘Why do you have to beat yourself up in order to make something?’” the London singer\/guitarist tells Apple Music. “Obviously, you have to work hard, but often the idea of really struggling is something that people inflict on others, just because it's the idea they sell to them, like, ‘Oh, you need to go through this.’” Yanya felt that she hadn't given herself enough time and space to make her 2019 debut, Miss Universe—a record based loosely, and playfully, around the concept of self-help and wellness, and what happens when you get too in your head about things. So, in the thick of the pandemic, she eased into making PAINLESS, writing the songs more collaboratively—mostly with producer Will Archer—than she had been used to. “I kind of felt a bit like, ‘Am I cheating?’ Because you're sharing the work, it feels lighter,” she says. \"But then because of that, I kind of delved in deeper and it got a bit darker.” (The album title actually comes from the “shameless” lyric “Until you fall, it's painless.”) Those depths can be felt both in Yanya's vocal dynamics and the sense of urgency that underpins much of the album, particularly on opener “the dealer” and “stabilise”, the first single. “I think the rhythm plays a big part in these songs,” Yanya says. “You feel like there needs to be an escape somewhere.” Here Yanya talks through PAINLESS, track by track. “the dealer” “It's like when someone's hiding behind their layers, or not being honest, but then also you're not being honest with yourself. My favourite lyric is 'I hope it's just the summertime you grew attached to,' because it's like you're lying to yourself. You’re not saying, 'Oh, it was this person that made the difference, or it was this person that I miss.' You're just saying, 'I had a great time,' and you're not being honest about why.” “L\/R” “[Producer] Bullion played me this beat, and it had this pitched drum in it. It just made me feel really happy and warm. It had this kind of marching feeling to it, which I really liked. It took us like a year to finish it, but the initial idea came really quickly. I like the almost spoken element to it, because it sounds like you're speaking rather than singing, but then the chorus is very much singing—and it took a while to get that right. It's kind of about so many things. In my notebook at the time, I'd written, 'Do less things'—like, less is more. That was my thinking behind the song: trying to enjoy simple things and not overcomplicate things.” “shameless” “It's a really intimate song. I felt like it was about someone that's trying to run away from stuff in their life, but they kind of don't have much hope. The vocals are very celestial—not something I really experimented with in the past. At first, I was going to kind of speak the words, but it needed a lighter touch, like something even more delicate.” “stabilise” “That was the first one me and Will did together. All the others kind of grew off that song. It's about environments and the way they impact you, and not being able to escape your environment, taking it with you wherever you go. And it kind of becomes your cage or the way you view things. You know when you've been somewhere too long and then it's hard to imagine the world another way? Definitely a very lockdown song.” “chase me” “I really liked the line 'Through corridors your love will chase me,' because it was like the safe feeling you can get when you know you are loved, but you don't necessarily want it. It's almost like an ego song for me. It's very confident.” “midnight sun” “I was digging into more of an overall feeling and a mood. I feel like it's a song about confidence and finding your own voice in order to speak up, whether that's about your own feelings or bigger issues: ‘I can't keep my mouth shut this time. I can't keep my head down. I'm not going along with this anymore.’” “trouble” “That song is so sad—in a beautiful way, if I may say so. It also felt like quite a brave one for me because it's very different. When I was writing, I was like, 'Am I doing a straight-up pop song?' It's not. I think it definitely has that take on it. The vocals needed to be more intimate. Like one voice, and it just all keeps spilling out. It's quite challenging to sing. ‘Trouble’ is one of those words—I think I heard it in a Cat Stevens song—'Trouble, set me free'—and I really loved the way it was being referred to almost like a person. In the lyrics here, it's something that's quite persistent and it's not going away. Something's definitely broken that you can't fix.” “try” “This one is about getting better, and feeling the need to connect on a deeper level, finding new depths and making new connections, but becoming confused, tired and dejected with the effort it takes.” “company” “It's about giving up and you're not in a happy place. Originally it started out as, like, you're in a relationship that you are just really not sure about and you're trying to give signs across that you're trying to get rid of someone. But I think the song now is definitely about your inner demons, and they're not really going away.” “belong with you” “I did this with Jazzi Bobbi, who's in my band. She does more electronic stuff, so that definitely comes into play. I feel like builds are always my favourite things in songs, and at the beginning we actually tried to overcomplicate the song and there was like a whole other section and it changed tempo and it just wasn't working. And I was like, 'We just need to keep building and that's it.' What it's about is like you're tied into something, but you know you're too good for it or you want to leave. I feel like these are all the songs, in a way. It’s like, escape—but you can't escape.” “the mystic” “It's about watching other people get on with their lives and feeling like you're being left behind. I spend a lot of time doing music, so that's where I put all my energy, and I was like, 'Oh, I thought we were all still doing that.' Other people have got other plans and you're like, 'Oh, you're a grown-up. You're going to move in with your boyfriend,' or, 'Oh, you can drive now.' The verse is really sad, because it's about watching that happen, and feeling very insecure and unconfident.” “anotherlife” “For me, this has a completely different energy. It's kind of like you're admitting you're lost now, but in a parallel universe or in the future, you won't always be lost. It's not always bad to be in that kind of lost, super-emotional, flung-out state. I find sometimes when something bad happens and you get really upset, it's kind of— I don't want to say cleansing, but you see things with this new kind of brilliance and clarity. And that's kind of a beautiful moment.”",

The elation of a good roller coaster or the nausea that sets in when the ride loses control? Birchard likes it all, and by the fistful. Nearly a decade out from his public christening as a producer for Kanye West (“Mercy”, “Blood on the Leaves”) and half of the jock-jam festival phenomenon TNGHT (with Lunice), he’s become the kind of musician it seems like he wanted to be all along: bright, weird, funky, funny and guided by an optimism so irrepressible you wonder if, deep down, he feels a little sad. “Stump” is the most beautiful music that didn’t make Blade Runner. “Bicstan” is Aphex Twin for a seven-year-old’s birthday party. He can balance tracks as abstract as “Kpipe” with ones as direct as “3 Sheets to the Wind”, and the soulful lag of American rap (“Redeem”) with the momentum of UK bass (“Rain Shadow”, “Is It Supposed”), not to mention whatever neon-halo hybrid “Behold” is. This is opera for people raised on anime. And as easy as it is to imagine listening in a big, sweaty room, he knows that most of us will end up taking it in alone on headphones—and he wants us to have fun.",

Superb job by Floating Points all over the place.\nFrom Pitchfork: “Throughout its emotional 46 minutes, Promises stirs feelings that can be hard to name. The first sound we hear is one that courses through the entire piece—a brief, seven-note refrain played by what seems to be a harpsichord, sometimes accented by a bell-like tone that could be the celeste. The cluster of sounds begins in silence, and we can hear the creak of wood and some shifting objects in the room where it was recorded, and it repeats every nine seconds for almost the duration of the piece. It’s a small twinkly loop that brings to mind the feeling of awakening, as if something that was unclear is now understood, there to be rediscovered with each cycle. And that repeating fragment holds the composition together, and every sound exists in relation to it, even if we can’t quite sense how they fit together.”",

But serenity is not the same as docility, and kick iiii also features some of Arca’s most coolly triumphant work to date. On the self-empowerment anthem “Queer”, Planningtorock testifies to their “tears of power”, while on “Alien Inside”, Garbage’s Shirley Manson solemnly intones the virtues of Arca’s self-proclaimed “mutant faith” over a shimmering shoegaze backdrop. Most affecting of all is Arca’s own proclamation on “Lost Woman Found”: “I’ve been walking toward the light for years now\/And it’s the first time I feel the sun’s warmth on my skin, now that it’s my own\/A lost woman, found.” The quest for one’s true identity has long been at the centre of Arca’s work, and here at the heart of her sprawling, futuristic bildungsroman, she channels years of trauma into something like peace.",

Fragments of sounds, it is nothing more but every fragment is right on track.\n\nFrom Pitchfork: “Sound Ancestors, his new album, is a rare entry in his vast catalog to be billed straightforwardly as a Madlib solo release, not a collaboration with a rapper, or a record by one of several fictitious jazz players and ensembles he’s invented, or an entry in an arcane thematic series. But it, too, is a joint effort, this time with Kieran Hebden, the electronic producer better known as Four Tet, who curated, edited, and arranged its 16 tracks from a body of hundreds of recordings that Madlib sent him over a period of two years. Their process reminds me of 2003’s Shades of Blue, which Madlib created by raiding the vaults of Blue Note Records, sometimes chopping the original jazz recordings intricately and sometimes letting them unfold for long stretches without much apparent editing. Now, Madlib is the one opening his archives, and Four Tet is the one listening and assembling.”",

On the guest front, Don Toliver matches her R&B potency amid the polyrhythmic blur of “Fantasy”, while Omar Apollo brings his own certain charm to the sumptuous duet “Worth the Wait”. Yet most of the album keeps the spotlight rightfully on her, leading to breathtaking moments like “I Wish You Roses” and the Sade-esque “Blue”. And while Red Moon in Venus returns the artist to a primarily English-language mode, she hasn’t dispatched entirely with the approach taken on 2020’s Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞. She brings bilingual lyricism alongside orchestral accents for “Como Te Quiero Yo” and retro grooves for “Hasta Cuando”.",

        "notes" : "Black Thought may be best-known as part of The Roots, performing night after late night for Jimmy Fallon’s TV audience, yet the Philadelphia native concurrently boasts a staggering reputation as a stand-alone rapper. Though he’s earned GOAT nods from listeners for earth-shaking features alongside Big Pun, Eminem and Rapsody, his solo catalogue long remained relatively modest in size. Meanwhile, Danger Mouse had a short yet monumental run in the 2000s that made him one of that decade’s most beloved and respected producers. His discography from that period contains no shortage of microphone dynamos, most notably MF DOOM (as DANGERDOOM) and Goodie Mob’s CeeLo Green (as Gnarls Barkley). Uniting these low-key hip-hop powerhouses is the stuff of hip-hop dreams, the kind of fantasy-league-style draft you’d encounter on rap message boards. Yet Cheat Codes is real—perhaps realer than real. Danger Mouse’s penchant for quirkily cinematic, subtly soulful soundscapes remains from the old days, but the growth from his 2010s work with the likes of composer Daniele Luppi gives “Aquamarine” and “Sometimes” undeniable big-screen energy. Black Thought luxuriates over these luxurious beats, his lyrical lexicon put to excellent use over the feverish funk of “No Gold Teeth” and the rollicking blues of “Close to Famous”. As if their team-up wasn’t enough, an intergenerational cabal of rapper guests bless the proceedings. From living legend Raekwon to A$AP Rocky to Conway the Machine, New York artists play a pivotal role here. A lost DOOM verse, apparently from The Mouse and the Mask sessions, makes its way onto the sauntering and sunny “Belize”, another gift for the fans.",

        "notes" : "Pitchfork: \n\n“After experiments in free jazz and psychedelia, the UK producer reckons with the rave music of his youth. It’s a utopian project that melds dance music’s forms with an organic sensibility.\n\nDrop the needle at any given point on James Holden’s fourth album, and you might think the music is building toward carefully orchestrated catharsis: the moment when the big melody finally drops in, or the various rhythms cohere into a single body-moving lockstep, and the crowd loses its collective mind. There were plenty of those moments in Holden’s earlier work, when he was a young DJ making sweeping trance and progressive techno anthems. But time and time again on Imagine This Is a High Dimensional Space of All Possibilities, the climax turns out to be an illusion. A filter sweep reaches its apex to reveal the full glowing resonance of a particular synth, and you realize the pulse of its chord progression has been working at cross purposes with the rest of the track, pulling you away from its patient groove rather than toward it. A strobe-lit rave piano arrives just in time for the drums to drop out entirely. \n\nHolden has said that the album is his attempt to recreate the sense of hearing, as a teenager, far-off pirate radio broadcasts of early UK dance music, the soundtracks to a woolly and utopian rave scene that had largely dried up by the time he was old enough to make music professionally and had to settle for more slickly commercial sounds. Thematically, this is not so different from the territory where Burial has made his career, summoning the atmospheres of emptied-out warehouse parties and solitary walks home. Rather than mourning a paradise lost, Holden instead focuses on the joy and freedom his younger self imagined those ravers must have been feeling. Every individual sound is as bright and welcoming as can be. It’s the way that these sounds cohere—or more often, refuse to—that suggests a certain distance. The album’s new-agey title may provoke eye rolls in some listeners, but the first word poignantly grounds it. If we have to imagine that this is a place where everything is possible, it probably isn’t in reality. \n\nBy the time of Holden’s first album, 2006’s The Idiots Are Winning, he was already dislodging himself from the club; his third, 2017’s The Animal Spirits, looked like a final break, with Holden leading a full live band on excursions into free jazz and Terry Riley-ish minimalism. His full-lengths have also reflected a growing interest in oblique, free-flowing rhythms, seemingly inspired by the unpredictable complexity of the natural world rather than the mechanistic precision of much dance music. While High Dimensional Space on one level represents a return to the timbres of clubland, it retains this organic sensibility. Acoustic instruments like saxophone and tabla punctuate “Common Land” and “Contains Multitudes,” respectively. The latter also plays with your expectation that the sounds of electronic dance music will stick to their own narrowly defined bands of the frequency range and roles in the larger arrangement. One particular keyboard ostinato begins in the middle, and traverses down to sub-bass depths and up to piercing heights over the course of the track. Listening closely is like watching a time lapse of a tree’s roots bursting through the sidewalk. \n\nThe quality of the rhythms across the album, each developing concurrently at its own pace rather than in strict alignment, mirrors the fragmentary timelines of nature as well. “Trust Your Feet” comes tantalizingly close to ecstatic release, its arpeggios percolating onward past the juncture where they might have locked in with the other instruments to deliver a satisfying payoff. Witnessing waterfalls and sunsets, there’s no single perfect moment when all the elements come together and make their mysterious relationships clear; this music works similarly, absorbing you in the whole of its trajectory rather than any specific waypoint. \n\nThe lack of definitive resolutions can make the album at times difficult to really love, rather than just appreciate or admire, despite the music’s unflagging optimism. The rare moments when everything does come together are the ones that move me the most: the tumbling snare drum and burbling modular synth of “Continuous Revolution,” rushing together toward a horizon we never quite glimpse; the droning violins and unexpectedly funky bass guitar of “Worlds Collide, Mountains Form,” which sound a bit like what might happen if the ancient architects of Stonehenge decided to form a jam band. In between these set pieces, the full enjoyment of Imagine This Is a High Dimensional Space of All Possibilities requires some imagination of your own, a sort of listening past the vaporous surface of the music. Like teenage Holden at the radio, you may sense a magical world there, just beyond what you can hear. “",

Music signee's follow-up to 2020’s Modus Vivendi, it is only to the extent that it has wounded her, caused her to wound someone else or forced her to treat wounds of her own. The project is heavy and operatic (production credits list Dave Sitek, johan lenox and Dave Hamelin, among others), and Shake sings frequently about relationships past (“Web”, “Stay”, “Medicine”, “Se Fue La Luz”), present (“Blue Velvet”, “Cocoon”, “Wine & Spirits”) and, in one instance—hopefully—future (“Invited”). What’s clearer than anything else across You Can’t Kill Me is that 070 Shake knows how to turn her pain into art.

        "notes" : "During the disorienting first few months of the pandemic, Simon Green hit a creative block. The British electronic musician, better known as Bonobo, felt trapped and isolated working out of his home in east Los Angeles, starved for live music and human interaction. “I desperately needed to get into a different headspace,” he tells Apple Music. “Really, I needed to get out of the house.” Green began taking solo camping trips into the area’s remote mountains and deserts in an effort to get his creative juices flowing. “Exploring California was a great way of breaking the monotony of being indoors all day,” he says. “During this time of zero stimulation, I felt like I had to make it for myself.” Fragments, his moody seventh album, born from these adventures, is a tribute to the West Coast’s wide-open spaces. A laidback mix of mesmerising techno, orchestral instrumentation and hushed R&B balladry, the project is as sprawling, peaceful and varied as the landscape itself. Here, he takes us inside the making of each track.\n“Polyghost” (feat. Miguel Atwood-Ferguson) “This began as a long, drawn-out, seven-minute techno track that didn’t make the final cut. But it was built on top of two important thematic elements: harp, which is played by Lara Somogyi, who I recorded and then sampled, and strings, which are played by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. In the end, I decided to keep just those two parts because they weave throughout the rest of the record and drew everything together. The minute I did that, it became the obvious opener.”\n“Shadows” (feat. Jordan Rakei) “Back in 2019, before I even started assembling this album, I was working on a track that felt like a reference to guys like Theo Parrish and Moodymann—that swingy, old-school Detroit sound. I had been listening to that Andrew Ashong song ‘Flowers’ and felt like, with a vocalist, this could be in that same area. I reached out to Jordan, who helped me work out the structure—a bit of tension and release—and it wound up being one of the first tracks I had in place for this project. I’ve been sitting on it for almost three years.”\n“Rosewood” “A good ways into making this album, I started to feel like I had the record but I didn’t have a proper single. So I went through my iPhone notes and voice memos and found a little piano loop that jumped out at me. I pulled it into Ableton and put a little kick drum under it and immediately felt like it could be the seeds of something. For the hook, I found this R&B a cappella on YouTube that had this little lyric of ‘I won't leave you.’ And I knew that was it.”\n“Otomo” (feat. O’Flynn) “This features an archived folk recording of a Bulgarian bagpipe choir that, to me, feels like a huge sample. It’s this big, droning, ethereal, cathedral-y thing, and I hadn’t heard anything like it before. I felt like it deserved to have some big moments around it, so I reached out to my friend O'Flynn, who does that so well—switching between tuneful melodies and percussive muscle. He wound up building an entire section for it, without even me prompting him, and it was perfect. It’s definitely the track that’s going to get played out in the club.”\n“Tides” (feat. Jamila Woods) “I’d been talking to Jamila and a few other vocalists about doing some collaborations, but nobody was feeling particularly motivated—it was too early into the pandemic. But then, in 2021, people came to life. Jamila texted me that she was going into the studio to record something, and it wound up being a demo that’s on the record. Hearing it really kick-started my creative energy. I remember when she first sent it to me, I was heading out for the night and was like, ‘I'm going to wait to listen to this until I get home, when I can really give it my full attention.' When I got back, I'd had a couple glasses of wine, so I was in the perfect state. I hit play, and I was just...overcome. I almost cried. It was like suddenly there was an emotional centrepiece to the record. It changed everything.”\n“Elysian” “This one is named after Elysian Park, which is very close to where I live in LA. Because it was the pandemic and most things were closed, I spent a lot of time in the park, going for walks, cycling up to Angels Point and so on. As this song came together, I listened to it while walking around in Elysian, so the tribute felt appropriate. It’s the midway point of the record, and felt like a good place to have a nice acoustic interlude. A moment of pause.”\n“Closer” “I was digging around in my archives and stumbled upon an old session recording with Andreya Triana, a singer-songwriter who I’d worked with back in 2009. I produced her debut album, Lost Where I Belong, in my apartment in London. I pulled some vocals from this one track ‘Far Closer’, and it worked really well. I hit her up and was like, ‘Hey! Remember this vocal? I've started sampling it again on this other thing.’ She got a kick out of it.” \n“Age of Phase” “Throughout this whole process, I was playing a lot with modular synths. It was a way of keeping the process exciting, to learn how to use different technology. ‘Age of Phase’ is basically exclusively modular synths, apart from the vocals, and that was a new thing for me. I wanted to create all these interweaving melodies and vocals and have everything reach this chaotic peak, before diving down into something really lush. I'm going to try to deconstruct it for the live show and see how far I can push that idea.”\n“From You” (feat. Joji) “This one seems like it’s a bit of a curveball for some people. Maybe myself as well. But I was trying to do something that sounded a bit more like contemporary hip-hop and R&B. I was listening to Kehlani, SZA, slowthai, even some James Blake, and was really inspired by that blended sound. I'd always wanted to work with Joji, because I think he's a really interesting musician, and when the parts all came together I was like, ‘Wow, okay, this is kind of a pop song. And I'm kind of into that.’”\n“Counterpart” “This song came together early on and was exactly the mix of sounds I was looking for—a little bit techno, but quite melodic, with lots of modular synths. It was so fun to make that I was sad when I finished it, so now I’m working on a live version as well. I think it’s going to have multiple lives.”\n“Sapien” “This is my throwback to early-'90s rave—artists like Mike Paradinas, Rephlex and Future Sound of London, that era of melodic, ravey breakbeats. I sent the piano part into a modular so I could get all those choppy synth parts that are actually from a Rhodes piano, and then I went apeshit on drum programming at the end as a way to hearken back to that era of frenetic drum breaks. It’s one of the more abrasive moments on the record, which I really like.”\n“Day by Day” (feat. Kadhja Bonet) “This is a straight R&B jam, really. I had spoken to Kadhja for ages and we'd sent demos back and forth. And the thing I like about this one is that it references earlier stuff of mine. It feels like it could be from the Black Sands era, which makes me feel like I’ve come full circle. I also like that it has a sense of optimism as the album closer, serving as a reminder that everything’s going to be all right.”",

Beving journeys through an array of influences, from the timelessness of Bach (“Accent Grave”, “Last Dance”) and Eastern modal inflection (“Dervish”) to the haunting simplicity of 19th-century French composer Erik Satie (“Le fee verte”). In the childlike, Chopin-inspired waltz “Paris s’enflamme”, Beving pays a heartfelt tribute to the French capital, while the final track, “Roses”, takes the role of a calming, hypnotic postlude.",

        "notes" : "On his milestone 10th album, pianist, composer, improviser and healer Nduduzo Makhathini distils a decade’s worth of creative output into an offering that reflects upon both his and his forebearer’s footsteps. “This whole journey started in 2012, when I went to studio to record my debut album,” he tells Apple Music. “This is me summarising my journey. This is the moment for a bird’s-eye view of the recurring themes and dialoguing that’s been taking place.” In the Spirit of Ntu muses on various ideas—from a range of disciplines—that collectively shape us. “An underpinning concept of ubuntu is that everything that lives carries vital force, and this vital force is what counts as ‘Ntu’,” Makhatini explains. “I’ve found that the hinge that connects all African art, music, religions, worldviews and histories is this notion of Ntu. This is the part the colonial system was not able to erase. This album is an intervention to hold on to the things that refused to be removed.” Crafted by a talented young lineup, these 10 tracks situate Makhathini’s ideas in the realm of sound. “I was grappling with what it means to locate the sonic inside of these conversations,” he says. “You exist in the context of the whole, and that became the underpinning conceptual view towards the bandstand—all the musicians are younger than me, to build continuity within that shared ‘insideness’ of this cultural sphere.” Here, Makhathini breaks down key tracks from the album. “Unonkanyamba” “When I was growing up, there was this myth that if there were heavy quakes, Inkanyamba [the serpent] was emerging from beneath the earth. When it emerges, there’s no way you can survive, and we were told we couldn’t see it cause we’d die immediately. As a kid, I’d internalised this as a masculine energy. Here, I use the idea of ‘Uno’ as pointing towards a different polarity. What if these energies were feminine? Anything that has to do with water, we consult Nomkhubulwane—that’s a deity or divinity for rain. There’s a sense in which the arising of Unonkanymaba could be seen as a metaphor for all the things that could possibly emerge from beneath the earth.” “Mama” (feat. Omagugu) “This whole album is underpinned by Ntu configured as essence, and essence as a space of origin. There’s always this feminine energy surrounding the womb and water. ‘Mama’ is a human manifestation of what Unonkanyamba would mean at a cosmic level. My wife, Omagugu, composed [this song] for my mother-in-law, who got sick and passed away. It’s paying tribute to a mother in a spiritual form—as part of the lineage of ancestors that can make interventions on our behalf. The sonic arrangement starts with a gentleness, then builds, almost like a foetus growing in the womb. The break is the idea of giving birth as something that is high frequency. Though it tries to give a sonic feeling of what it means to be a mother, it asks what it means to lose one.” ”Amathongo” “In English, we say you’re in ‘deep sleep’, which has nothing to do with being elsewhere—in a world that functions. In isiZulu, we say ‘usebuthongweni’, which means he or she is one with the ‘star gods’ or amathongo. That says something about sleep as this moment where we’re actually alive in another reality. Ntu speaks about how we collapse these two realities. So, when I say, ‘Vumani vumani vumani weZangoma,’ it’s because you have to surrender. Through this invocation of ‘ukuvuma’ [‘to agree or concur’], a collective agreement enables a ritual state where time and space are suspended. When I grew up, jazz musicians had no sense of cultural situatedness. There was no relationship between amathongo and the things that we see around us, until Busi Mhlongo and Zim Ngqawana arrived. They brought these connections in a more deliberate way, so this is part of that codification.” “Emlilweni” (feat. Jaleel Shaw) “In various creation stories on the [African] continent, the earth was once filled with fire. When water emerged, all the fires escaped to the underworlds as a sign of obedience. As we speak about the underworlds, we also speak about the location of our ancestors, so it’s interesting to me how South Africans use fire as one of our codes for expressing our tiredness. We're so tired, we’re telling our ancestors that we need bigger interventions. This was the language post-coloniality and still is. Throughout these time periods, we’ve viewed musicians as operating from the edges of these burning fires—to propel the fire burning in the middle. Given the urgency of things to change in a very fragile system, there’s an even deeper urgency for musicians to enunciate from within these burning fires instead of from around them.” “Omnyama” “When I first heard Mfaz’Omnyama, his voice would just cut through. He always projected something that was distant from here—something untouchable by the systems. Bab’ Mfaz’Omnyama, Mam’ Busi Mhlongo and Bab’ Phuzekhemisi were unlocking codes, and if you heard that, that was your access. They were like, ‘I’m giving this to you, and the only way to enter is for you to hear, to sense.’ I think of Maskanda musicians as a radical movement. To pick up a Western classical instrument and do a full-on colonisation of it is radical—the guitar was speaking English, and they made it speak isiZulu! Through this unconventional tuning, they were telling us something deeper about how to make these tools obey your own story.” “Senze’ Nina” “We’ve seen how men are targeted in a deep way, even during apartheid. We grew up without our fathers, and these were the creations of dysfunctionality in the Black family. There are problematic constructs we’ve created ourselves, too, and men really need to add gentleness to their vocabulary of masculinity. ‘Senze’ Nina’ is about the truth that at the very core of every man lives a gentleness that is inherent just by the mere fact that they were born of a mother. I propose the idea of the making of a new man when that gentleness needs to be reawakened. Some of the most powerful things are projected with a gentleness!” “Ntu” “In the Spirit of Ntu starts with all these things that are clashing and conflicting, and it ends with this gentle solo piano—this very utopian place. All the things that happen on this album are things that you can see, but this last song leads into a dream and happens elsewhere. This music is one of those ritual technologies that takes us to different locations, where you enter a space and come out of it different. Ntu is that reconfiguration of self.”",

        "notes" : "After the pandemic hit, Harley Streten left his adopted home, LA, for his real one, Australia. He moved to Byron Bay in Northern NSW and set up a new, quieter life for himself. “I’ve got property, I live on an acreage, I just live a simple life,” he tells Apple Music. “I grow my own vegetables. I have a snake that lives in my roof that sometimes crawls down to my front door.” It’s about as far removed as you can get from the bustle and drama of the city that placed him into “not in a particularly productive space or good space”. It’s here that he set up a new studio and got to work on the pieces that would become his third album, Palaces. The producer’s first two albums propelled him from Sydney’s nightclubs to festival stages around the world. His 2016 release, Skin, was built on the warped, unique production style he’d become known for and earned him his first Grammy. The next few years were packed with touring—until the pandemic hit. “This time has been really good for me, mentally—it’s just really given me a chance to slow down,” he says. “I got on this train, it started speeding up and getting faster and faster. When I was 19, I started touring and it just didn’t stop. Then COVID happened, and I had two years to just be a normal human. It’s been fantastic.” Palaces stretches in every direction. The sounds and style Streten is known for flings itself into new places, big and small, heavy and tender. There’s a healthy array of collaborators, including Caroline Polachek, who sings on the cinematic “Sirens”. “I’m really proud of that song,” Streten says. “Caroline was in lockdown at the time in London and she was hearing all the sirens outside. The song is like, ‘I wish I could start world peace. It would be really lovely to be able to just wave a wand and end all suffering.’” Streten’s trademark head rush of textures is still well-represented on the skittering “ESCAPE” (featuring longtime collaborator Kučka), “Hollow” (featuring Emma Louise) and “Say Nothing” (featuring MAY-A)—all proof of his continuing expertise when it comes to big, emotive pop. Meanwhile, Spanish DJ and producer Virgen Maria evokes playful sexuality with her vocal contributions on “Only Fans”. “It can go from zero to 100 and then back to zero,” he says of his music’s sudden hairpin turns and mood swings. But there are plenty of soft, ruminative moments here, too, such as ambient centrepiece “Jasper’s Song”, featuring pianist Jasper Harris. “That was originally a house track,” Streten reveals. “It was a full house banger. But I then felt like it took away from the beauty of it, so I stripped it all the way back and just had it as this ambient piano piece. It feels like a nice contrast in the record. There’s a lot of hard stuff, so it’s nice to have some really mellow, warm feelings.” And the closing track concludes the album in a gorgeous, atmospheric manner. It starts with field recordings from around Streten’s property, and slowly builds, rhythm and ambient chords billowing out behind Damon Albarn’s vocals. “Working with him, it was cool,” Streten says. “I’m a huge fan. I was nervous. I was fucking nervous.” A decade since his debut album, Streten has found his stride. Much like how his music darts from intense to meditative, hard-hitting to mellow, he’s realised his life, too, is all about equilibrium. “Now, I’ve got a really nice balance between LA and Australia, two ends of the spectrum,” he says. But he can’t overstate how important his choice was to move home, to take a break. In fact, the album name was inspired by the solace he felt after leaving LA. “I’d gone home to Australia, started life in the countryside and felt like I’d found my palace. That’s where the record really came together. I was having a bit of trouble with music in the States. Going home—all that room, the simple life, it just gave me the space to create. And it just felt like a sanctuary.”",

        "notes" : "“I had a responsibility to give people what they were asking for, especially during the pandemic,” Robert Glasper tells Apple Music. “They wanted another Black Radio, so I had to deliver.” The pianist, composer, songwriter and producer has spent the past decade pushing the boundaries of what constitutes jazz music, combining its acoustic instrumentation with hip-hop swagger, R&B melodies and an ear attuned to improvisation. Ten years after the first Black Radio album, he returns to the genre-hopping, collaborative format, producing 13 tracks that seamlessly transition from the power of Amir Sulaiman’s poetry on opener “In Tune” to an elegantly downbeat version of Tears for Fears’ “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” to the funk of “Why We Speak” with Q-Tip and Esperanza Spalding. Here, Glasper talks through all the collaborations, track by track. “In Tune” (feat. Amir Sulaiman) “I was scoring a Dave Chappelle documentary, and in the film, Amir performs a poem that floored me. I’ve never had a poem reach me that way. I was in tears. I immediately asked Dave to connect us, and we had a short conversation about what I was looking for. Two days later, he came back with this incredible poem that opens the record. A lot has happened in the 10 years since the first Black Radio, and a whole lot has happened for Black people in America in the last two years. I felt like I had to address the elephant in the room with this track and with ‘Black Superhero’.” “Black Superhero” (feat. Killer Mike, BJ The Chicago Kid & Big K.R.I.T.) “BJ is my bro, but this is the first time we’ve done something together on wax. He came to the studio, and I was just playing around and testing the keyboard and he said, ‘That sounds like some superhero shit,’ so I kept playing and the concept started from there. After that, I wanted to pick rappers that teach us. I wanted them to say something that spoke to this moment. I knew K.R.I.T. and Killer Mike would do it justice.” “Shine” (feat. Robert Glasper, D Smoke & Tiffany Gouche) “‘Shine’ came out of a jam session. I was playing drums and my drummer was playing keys and we came up with this riff that I then looped. I refined it on keys and added bass and then sent it to D Smoke to see what he thought. He sent me back a draft the next day. The song is all about self-love and knowing that you’re enough. That’s something I feel like a lot of hip-hop songs don’t talk about, and especially during the pandemic, people needed to hear that.” “Why We Speak” (feat. Q-Tip & Esperanza Spalding) “A lot of my music starts off with jam sessions. I have my guys come over and we throw down some vibes and see what sticks. We came up with this joint and, immediately, I thought of Esperanza. I sent it to her and a few days later, she sent it back, and I thought something was wrong with the mic. She never told me she was writing it in French! I thought it was so dope, though, and I realised it sounded like something that would fit Q-Tip too. I used to play in his band, but I’ve never had him rock on an album, so it was perfect.” “Over” (feat. Yebba) “Yebba was part of the Fuck Yo Feelings sessions. She’s become like a little sister to me since, and I knew I had to have her on the record. While we were at Electric Lady Studios, listening to her latest album, we jammed and came up with this pattern and the skeleton of the song. That was in early 2021, and a few months later, we got back to LA and finished up here at my studio. Her voice is so beautiful, and I’m so happy we got to make this one together.” “Better Than I Imagined” (feat. H.E.R. + Meshell Ndegeocello) “I scored a film called The Photograph, which came out in February 2020. H.E.R. sang the ending song for the movie, and at the premiere, she told me she was so inspired by my score that she wanted to write something together. We literally went from the movie theatre to the studio and wrote ‘Better Than I Imagined’. It wasn’t planned for any project, but it did so well when I put it out, it planted the seed for the rest of Black Radio III.” “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” (feat. Lalah Hathaway & Common) “I have this thing with Lalah. On the first Black Radio, she did a cover of ‘Cherish the Day’ and killed it. The next time, I was like, ‘Let’s do Stevie Wonder’s “Jesus Children of America”.’ She recorded it in one take, and it won a Grammy. So why not keep it going? I’ve always loved ‘Everybody Wants to Rule the World’—I don’t think I would trust a person who doesn’t like that song—but I don’t know anyone who has made a version of it. I redid it in my own vibe, and Common loved it so much, he invited himself on it too!” “Everybody Love” (feat. Musiq Soulchild & Posdnous) “My DJ, Jahi Sundance, and I wanted to make a house EP together, and this was the first song we wrote for it. I sent it to Musiq Soulchild, who I have known for a long time, and he came up with his joint in three days. I’ve never done a house song and neither has he, so it was new for both of us. It has a party vibe, and when it comes to party rappers, I always think of De La Soul and Posdnuos. I knew he would kill it, and he delivered.” “It Don’t Matter” (feat. Gregory Porter & Ledisi) “I have wanted to produce an R&B album with Gregory for a while now, and when his tour with Ledisi got cancelled, I called them both up. I was luckily able to get them in the studio because the COVID restrictions had eased at that point, and they wrote it to fit their voices. They’re both so powerful and definitely have their own sound, so this felt like a match made in heaven.” “Heaven’s Here” (feat. Ant Clemons) “I went to Snoop Dogg’s birthday party and on my way out, Ant Clemons stopped me and introduced himself. Terrace Martin told me that he’s high-level and that we should work together. Fast-forward to the next week and we started writing songs. We wrote four or five tracks since he was working with Justin Timberlake on his new album and Usher too. This was one we were going to give to Usher, but it didn’t work out with the timing. I love it so much, I had to put it on Black Radio.” “Out of My Hands” (feat. Jennifer Hudson) “Jennifer came to one of my shows with my homegirl Kelly Rowland, who I know from Houston. They both sat in with me onstage, and I knew I had to get Jennifer on something. When I wrote this song, I heard her voice on it. It took us a little while to get together, but she performed it perfectly.” “Forever” (feat. PJ Morton & India.Arie) “PJ worked with me on Black Radio 2 back in 2013, and he wrote the song ‘Worries’, which Dwele sang. I love matching people up who’ve never recorded together, since it makes the song become more special. I knew PJ and India would sound perfect together, and we luckily managed to make this more of a back-and-forth process to make it feel like a duet where we were in the studio at the same time.” “Bright Lights” (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)” “I’ve jammed with Ty before. He is a legend who changed the game up, and I wanted to do something with a modern, pop-R&B vibe because that’s where Ty thrives. It’s different from any of the other Black Radio tracks that I’ve made, and so I wanted to end the album with this one because it has such a unique feel.”",

But Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul effortlessly combine lean, punchy electro-pop with an unapologetically sarcastic sense of humour. On the Belgian duo’s debut album, Topical Dancer, the two musicians draw on their multicultural backgrounds to take sly potshots at racism, sexism and self-doubt. On “Esperanto”, Adigéry riffs on microaggressions over plunging electric bass, and on “Blenda”, she marries a crisp, funky groove with a surprisingly vulnerable chorus: “Go back to your country where you belong\/Siri, can you tell me where I belong?” Co-produced by their long-time collaborators Soulwax, the album slices neatly across the overlap between punky disco, indie dance and underground house; ’80s avant-pop influences (Art of Noise, Talking Heads) brush up against the sing-speaking wit of contemporaries like Marie Davidson and Dry Cleaning. Some of the album’s most powerful moments transcend language entirely: On “Haha”, Adigéry’s laughter is chopped up and dribbled over an EBM-inspired beat, making for a slow-motion floor-filler that’s as surreal as it is captivating.",

The title “A&W” both refers to the roadside chain restaurant and stands for “American Whore”—the original title, according to producer Jack Antonoff. In the song, Lana garbles the name of a Marielle Heller film, references a three-star hotel and Forensic Files, and interpolates a doo-wop standard you might know from the Tom Hanks film Big. A man named Jimmy appears, perhaps the same mythic Jim who’s popped up throughout her discography, as do chopped up, tape-filtered strings that sound like they’re from “Norman Fucking Rockwell.” If a single song could act as a crash source in Lana signifiers, this would be it.\n\nAnd yet, taken as a whole, “A&W” is unlike anything she’s ever made. It’s a psychedelic, collagist freakout that rides from exasperation—“I’m a princess, I’m divisive\/Ask me why I’m like this\/Maybe I just kinda like this”—all the way through to the delirious liberation of accepting your status as a lifelong outcast. By its end, she’s taunting the object of her affection with a wry, wily grin: “Your mom called, I told her you’re fucking up big time\/But I don’t care, baby, I already lost my mind.” Lana has always operated with a kind of creative abandon seemingly at odds with conventional wisdom, but “A&W” might be the ultimate expression of that wildness, a chimeric, haunted folk-trap ballad welded together with nothing but the heat of her own star power.",

        "notes" : "Should have been in the chart already for a while. Song is getting better and better. \nAnd exactly this describes the song best: “Without a doubt, Nayar’s most blissful and impressive demonstration of these compositional skills is displayed on the titanic “Tetramorph”, a ten-minute, three-act astral projection that is not only the best song on Heaven Come Crashing, but one of the best songs released by any artist this year. Disorientingly panned synths introduce the listener to a sunrise over an urban sprawl, followed by heavenly waves of swells and distant tremolo picking. This euphoric combination builds in intensity for four minutes before giving way to the album’s most aggressive section, marked by skittish hi-hats, glitchier electronics, and towering supersaws. Before this outburst can even be grasped onto, the storm has dissipated, and the song’s intro is stunningly revisited before an ambient guitar outro that is nothing shy of exhilarating.”",

They’ve always had an interest in Americana, but their touchpoints are warmer now: A sweetly sawing fiddle (“Spud Infinity”), a front-porch lullaby (“Dried Roses”), the wonder of a walk in the woods (“Promise Is a Pendulum”) or comfort of a kitchen where the radio’s on and food sizzles in the pan (“Red Moon”). Adrianne Lenker’s voice still conveys a natural reticence—she doesn’t want to believe it’s all as beautiful as it is—but she’s also too earnest to deny beauty when she sees it.",

        "notes" : "Black Thought may be best-known as part of The Roots, performing night after late night for Jimmy Fallon’s TV audience, yet the Philadelphia native concurrently boasts a staggering reputation as a stand-alone rapper. Though he’s earned GOAT nods from listeners for earth-shaking features alongside Big Pun, Eminem and Rapsody, his solo catalogue long remained relatively modest in size. Meanwhile, Danger Mouse had a short yet monumental run in the 2000s that made him one of that decade’s most beloved and respected producers. His discography from that period contains no shortage of microphone dynamos, most notably MF DOOM (as DANGERDOOM) and Goodie Mob’s CeeLo Green (as Gnarls Barkley). Uniting these low-key hip-hop powerhouses is the stuff of hip-hop dreams, the kind of fantasy-league-style draft you’d encounter on rap message boards. Yet Cheat Codes is real—perhaps realer than real. Danger Mouse’s penchant for quirkily cinematic, subtly soulful soundscapes remains from the old days, but the growth from his 2010s work with the likes of composer Daniele Luppi gives “Aquamarine” and “Sometimes” undeniable big-screen energy. Black Thought luxuriates over these luxurious beats, his lyrical lexicon put to excellent use over the feverish funk of “No Gold Teeth” and the rollicking blues of “Close to Famous”. As if their team-up wasn’t enough, an intergenerational cabal of rapper guests bless the proceedings. From living legend Raekwon to A$AP Rocky to Conway the Machine, New York artists play a pivotal role here. A lost DOOM verse, apparently from The Mouse and the Mask sessions, makes its way onto the sauntering and sunny “Belize”, another gift for the fans.",

        "notes" : "After recording The Car, there was, for “quite a long time, a real edit in process,” Arctic Monkeys leader Alex Turner tells Apple Music. Indeed, his UK rock outfit’s daring seventh LP sounds nothing if not composed—a set of subtle and stupendously well-mannered mid-century pop that feels light years away from the youthful turbulence of their historic 2006 debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not. If, back then, they were writing songs with the intention of uncorking them onstage, they’re now fully in the business of craft—editing, shaping, teasing out the sort of sumptuous detail that reveals itself over repeated listens. “It’s obviously 10 songs, but, even more than we have done before, it just feels like it’s a whole,” he says. “It’s its own.” The aim was to pay more attention to dynamics, to economy and space. “Everything,” Turner says, “has its chance to come in and out of focus,” whether it’s a brushed snare or a feline guitar line, a feathered vocal melody or devastating turn of phrase. Where an earlier Monkeys song may have detonated outward, a blast of guitars and drums and syllables, these are quiet, controlled, middle-aged explosions: “It doesn't feel as if there's too many times on this record where everything's all going on at once.” On album opener “There’d Better Be a Mirrorball”, Turner vaults from a bed of enigmatic, opening-credit-like keys and strings (all arranged with long-time collaborator James Ford and composer Bridget Samuels) into scenes of a prolonged farewell. So much of its pain—its romance, its dramatic tension—is in what’s not said. “The feel of that minute-or-so introduction was what feels like the foundation of the whole thing,” he says. “And it really was about finding what could hang out with that or what could be built around the feel of that. The moment when I found a way to bridge it into something that is a pop song by the end was exciting, because I felt like we had somewhere to go.” For years, Turner has maintained a steady diet of side work, experimenting with orchestral, Morricone-like epics in The Last Shadow Puppets as well as lamplit bedroom folk on 2011’s Submarine EP, written for the film of the same name. But listen closely to The Car (and 2018’s Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino before it) and you’ll hear the walls between the band and his interests outside it begin to dissolve—the string arrangements throughout (but especially on “The Car”), the gently fingerpicked guitars (“Mr Schwartz”), the use of negative space (the slightly Reznor-y “Sculptures of Anything Goes”). “I think I was naive,” he says. “I think the first time I stepped out to do anything else was the first Puppets record, and at that moment, I remember thinking, ‘Oh, this is totally in its own place and it's going to have nothing to do with the Monkeys and what that was going to turn into.’ And I realise now that I don't know if that's really possible, for me anyway. It feels as if everything you do has an effect on the next thing.”",

        "notes" : "Coming off the back of 2019’s excellent The Book of Traps and Lessons and the critically acclaimed play Paradise at London’s National Theatre in 2021, MC and poet Kae Tempest’s fourth album is their most ambitious, personal and open to date. Made with longtime collaborator and producer Dan Carey, the record moves in a series of bold musical and thematic suites that take in collaborators including Lianne La Havas, South London rapper Confucius MC, Fontaines D.C.’s Grian Chatten and BROCKHAMPTON’s Kevin Abstract. The Line Is a Curve is about letting go of the anxieties and fears that hold you back and embracing life’s cyclical nature. “This record is meant to symbolise a journey through different pressures,” says Tempest, “whether it’s the pressures of a relationship, or trying to survive and build the name for yourself or just trying to get through the day. It will mean something different to everybody, but that’s the beauty of language.” Here, they talk us through The Line Is a Curve, track by track. “Priority Boredom” “It’s an evocation of a feeling that I imagine we all are familiar with, which is the relentless pressure of existence and the forces competing for our attention. It’s meant to plunge you directly into the experience of the dull numbness and the claustrophobia of life in the present moment. What it’s saying is this race to death that we call progress or happiness or the pursuit of normal activity, happy families or whatever the value system is that we’ve swallowed up and are trying to recreate is actually extremely taxing for the individual and also for the community. It’s quite sarcastic in its own way. It’s meant to be knowing rather than an actual description of our lives.” “I Saw Light” (feat. Grian Chatten) “I’ve wanted to work with Grian ever since I met him. My desire was to have Grian’s voice contributing a poem because I feel him in that way, as a poet. When you put somebody else’s words alongside yours, you create this friction between the verses that creates new meaning. It gives the words a new energy, a new dimension. Grian putting his words down transformed and affected the verse that I had already written. It’s beautiful.” “Nothing to Prove” “It’s a statement song. It’s powerful in its musicality. I love the beat. The first and the second verses are absolutely phonetically matched. There is communication going on between the transformations in the lyric as it begins in one way, and then as it transforms in the other way, so you have this kind of call-and-response between two verses. For me as a writer, a rhymer and a lyricist, to be doing that on a record is an embodiment of having nothing to prove. It’s like, ‘Here, look what this song is doing.’ It’s like this chorus, musicality, lyricism, flow that are all saying the same thing. There’s nothing to prove—it’s all to play for.” “No Prizes” (feat. Lianne La Havas) “It’s close-up portraits of three characters and Lianne’s voice is the overarching theme or the undercurrent of what is common with all of them. The same thing that is occurring for them all, and all of us, in this world where we’ve set the album—where the dominant mythology says, ‘I’ve just got to keep climbing, and I don’t know why.’ I’ve known Lianne for a long time, and I love her voice passionately. There’s mutual respect and friendship there, and it just felt like the right time to try and bring some of that energy through into the record.” “Salt Coast” “It’s a love letter to Britain. Within my imagination, this island was embodied as this kid, this young girl. I suppose I was thinking about my childhood. I was thinking about the people I knew and loved as a kid, the people that made the most profound impact on me, and also the particular Britishness of that time. It’s acknowledging all of the complexities of loving home. It’s a complex place to love but, for me, it’s no less beautiful than any other. It’s home. I’ve gone deeply into why this soil feels the way it feels to me. I really want it to be the unofficial England World Cup anthem. Imagine that on the terraces.” “Don’t You Ever” “Kwake Bass plays the drums. We’ve been friends since childhood. He’s one of the greatest drummers of our generation, I think. The guitar part is by this guy Luke [Eastop]. We were all in a band together when we were about 19 years old, and the music on this, not the lyrics, was something that we used to play together when we were doing all of these hippie festivals. I just thought to myself on this record, ‘I want to get everybody together again. I want us to play together, and I want to do a kind of grown-up version of that song.’ Because it’s a fucking brilliant song.” “These Are the Days” “This is one that me and Dan wrote together in this weird studio lockdown situation. It’s this big, epic production, but we were writing it on a very minimised kit. We knew we wanted to do it live, so when the band came in to do ‘Don’t You Ever’, we also did ‘These Are the Days’ with all of the horns and the same crew playing the bass and the drums. That had a huge impact on it. It’s us saying, ‘Yeah, these are the days, this is the time, let’s fucking play this song!’” “Smoking” (feat. Confucius MC) “When I started rapping—and I’m talking about 15, 16 years old—Confucius was instrumental in guiding me. His lyricism was profound for me. We were in a crew together, and he was an important person in my creative life. If it wasn’t for those people, I would not be here, so I wanted to bring my community into my creativity. It sounds the way it does because I recorded it backstage at a festival and sent it to Dan as a voice note, which I often do.” “Water in the Rain” (feat. Assia) “It’s kind of setting myself free from some stuff that I’ve been suffering from with poor mental health. I think sometimes singing about it, just describing it and going into the experience of it, can take some of the fear out of what you experience when you’re experiencing it in isolation. It’s a profound moment on the album for me.” “Move” “I think of the album as a series of suites. You start with ‘Smoking’ and all of the themes that come up in that and then you move into ‘Water in the Rain’, which is this unleashing of deep emotion, which then opens up the space for us to get to ‘Move’. ‘Move’ is a response to what’s come before. I’ve connected with the tenderness, so now I can really dig deep and find my strength. This is the time to get up off the floor and stand up for yourself. The idea of ‘Move’ is that you earn that strength by being that vulnerable. It’s a fight song. I might be losing right now, but I’m not going to give up.” “More Pressure” (feat. Kevin Abstract) “The Line Is a Curve builds its momentum. It’s like a wave: You build up all of this galvanising spirit of fight, and that’s what enables you to reframe the narrative of the pressures that you’re under. Now you can say, ‘Right, I get it. I’m under all this pressure, but I’m going to use all this pressure, and I’m going to use this energy to make change and cultivate greater acceptance.’ It’s all part of this swell that begins at the start of the record. Rick Rubin suggested that I give Kevin a shout. It’s not quite as close to home as the other collaborations, which are very much based in South London, but it opens the record up a bit more and, hopefully, allows more people in.” “Grace” “It’s like a prayer. It’s this repeated refrain that comes back to me. When I’m in need, I go back to those words: ‘Let me be loved. Let me be loving.’ I would say those words to myself before going out onstage to do a performance of The Book of Traps and Lessons. It’s become something to keep me grounded. It feels really fitting that this song came out of the sessions making this album, but then it’s something that had its place in other works that I’ve done. Dan is playing the synth line to ‘Priority Boredom’ on the guitar, so it leads you back around in a circle. It’s such a gentle, tender way of finishing the album.”",

        "artist" : "Taylor Swift",
        "id" : "1649434996",
        "notes" : "Let‘s start with that speech. In September 2022, as Taylor Swift accepted Songwriter-Artist of the Decade honours at the Nashville Songwriter Awards, the headline was that Swift had unveiled an admittedly “dorky” system she’d developed for organising her own songs. Quill Pen, Fountain Pen, Glitter Gel Pen: three categories of lyrics, three imagined tools with which she wrote them, one pretty ingenious way to invite obsessive fans to lovingly obsess all the more. And yet, perhaps the real takeaway was the manner in which she spoke about her craft that night, some 20 years after writing her first song at the age of 12. “I love doing this thing we are fortunate enough to call a job,” she said to a room of her peers. “Writing songs is my life’s work and my hobby and my never-ending thrill. A song can defy logic or time. A good song transports you to your truest feelings and translates those feelings for you. A good song stays with you even when people or feelings don’t.” On Midnights, her tenth LP and fourth in as many years—if you don’t count the two she’s just re-recorded and buttressed with dozens of additional tracks—Swift sounds like she’s really enjoying her work, playing with language like kids do with gum, thrilling to the texture of every turn of phrase, the charge in every melody and satisfying rhyme. Alongside long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff, she’s set out here to tell “the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout [her] life”, as she phrased it in a message to Apple Music subscribers. It’s a concept that naturally calls for a nocturnal palette: slower tempos, hushed atmosphere, negative space like night sky. The sound is fully modern (synths you’d want to eat or sleep in, low end that sits comfortably on your chest), while the aesthetic (soft focus, wood panelling, tracklist on the cover) is decidedly mid-century, much like the Mad Men-inspired title of its brooding opener, “Lavender Haze”—a song about finding refuge in the glow of intimacy. “Talk your talk and go viral,” she sings, in reference to the maelstrom of outside interest in her six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn. “I just want this love spiral.” (A big shout to Antonoff for those spongy backup vocals, btw.) In large part, Midnights is a record of interiors, Swift letting us glimpse the chaos inside her head (“Anti-Hero”, wall-to-wall zingers) and the stillness of her relationship (“Sweet Nothing”, co-written by Alwyn under his William Bowery pseudonym). For “Snow on the Beach”, she teams up with Lana Del Rey—an artist whose instinct for mood and theatrical framing seems to have influenced Swift’s recent catalogue—recalling the magic of an impossible night over a backdrop of pizzicato violin, sleigh bells and dreamy Mellotron, like the earliest hours of Christmas morning. “I’ve never seen someone lit from within,” Swift sings. “Blurring out my periphery.” But then there’s “Bejeweled”, a late, 1989-like highlight on which she announces to an unappreciative partner, a few seconds in: “And by the way, I’m going out tonight.” And then out Swift goes, striding through the centre of the song like she would the room: “I can still make the whole place shimmer,” she sings, relishing that last word. “And when I meet the band, they ask, ‘Do you have a man?’\/I could still say, ‘I don’t remember.’” There are traces of melancholy layered in (see: “sapphire tears on my face”), but the song feels like a triumph, the sort of unabashed, extroverted fun that would have probably seemed out of place in the lockdown indie of 2020’s folklore and evermore. But here, side by side with songs and scenes of such writerly indulgence, it’s right at home—more proof that the terms “singer-songwriter” and “universal pop star” aren’t mutually exclusive ideas. “What’s a girl gonna do?” Swift asks at its climax. “A diamond’s gotta shine.”",

        "notes" : "Although Dry Cleaning began work on their second album before the London quartet had even released their 2021 debut, New Long Leg, there was little creative overlap between the two. “I definitely think of it as a different chapter,” drummer Nick Buxton tells Apple Music. “I think one of the nicest things was just knowing what we were in for a bit more,” adds singer Florence Shaw. “It was less about, ‘What are we doing?’ and more thinking about what we were playing.” Recorded in the same studio (Wales’ famous Rockfield Studios) with the same producer (PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish) as New Long Leg, Stumpwork sees Shaw, Buxton, bassist Lewis Maynard and guitarist Tom Dowse hone the wiry post-punk and rhythmical bursts of their debut. The jangly guitar lines are melodically sharper and the grooves more locked in as Shaw’s observational, spoken-word vocals pull at the threads of life’s big topics, even when she’s singing about a missing tortoise. “When we finished New Long Leg, I always felt a bit like, ‘Ah, I’d like another chance at that.’ With this one, it definitely felt like, ‘Really happy with that,’” says Buxton. The quartet take us on a tour of Stumpwork, track by track. “Anna Calls From the Arctic” Nick Buxton: “It was a very late decision to start the album with this. I think it’s quite unusual because it’s very different from a lot of the other songs on the album.” Florence Shaw: “I quite liked that the album opened with a question: ‘Should I propose friendship?’ In the outro, we were thinking about the John Barry song ‘Capsule in Space’, from You Only Live Twice. There’s quite a bit of that in the outro. At least, it was on the mood board.” “Kwenchy Kups” NB: “It’s named after those little plastic pots you get when you’re a kid—pots full of some luminous liquid, and you pierce the film on the lid with a straw.” FS: “We were at a studio in Easton in Bristol, and I wrote a lot of the lyrics on walks around the area. It’s a really nice little area, and there’s lots of interesting shops. We wanted to write a few more joyful songs, at least in tone, and the song is so cheerful-sounding. So, some of the lyrics came out of that, too, wanting to write something that was optimistic, the idea of watching animals or insects being just a simple, joyful thing to do.” “Gary Ashby” NB: “This is about a real tortoise.” FS: “On a walk in lockdown, I saw a ‘lost’ poster for ‘Gary Ashby’. The rest of the story came out of imagining the circumstances of him disappearing and the idea that it’s obviously a family tortoise because he’s got this surname. It’s thinking about family and things getting lost in chaos, when things are a bit chaotic in the home and pets escape. We don’t know what happened to him. We don’t know if he’s alive or dead, which is a little bit disturbing, but hopefully we’ll find out one day.” “Driver’s Story” NB: “We were rehearsing at a little studio in the basement at our record label [4AD]. It was just me, Tom and Lewis, and we weren’t there very long, but quite a few ideas for songs came out of that. The main bit of ‘Driver’s Story’ was one. It felt different to anything we’d done on New Long Leg. It’s just got such a nice, oozy feel to it. FS: “There’s a bit in the song about a jelly shoe and the idea of it being buried in your guts. A photographer called Maisie Cousins does photos of lots of bodily stuff and liquids, but with flowers and beautiful things as well. I was looking at a lot of those at the time. The jelly-shoe thing is about that—something pretty, plastic-y, mixed with guts.” Tom Dowse: “It’s got my dog barking on the end of it as well. He’s called Buckley. He is credited on the record.” “Hot Penny Day” TD: “I’d been listening to a lot of Rolling Stones, so this is an attempt at that. We were jamming it through, and it started to take on a bit more of a stoner-rock vibe. ‘Driver’s Story’ was also meant to be a bit more stoner-rock until John Parish got his hands in it and took the drugs out of it.” Lewis Maynard: “I found a bass wah pedal in my sister’s garage. I just plugged it in and started playing, and I was like, ‘This is fun’. I’ve unfortunately not stopped playing bass wah.” NB: “It conjures up quite a lot of imagery. I was listening to some of Jonny Greenwood’s music for the film Inherent Vice, and it’s got a washed-out, desert-y feel. This sounds like Dry Cleaning in an alternate, parallel universe somewhere.” “Stumpwork” FS: “Quite a lot of the lyrics were gleaned from this archive of newspaper clippings that I went to in Woolwich Arsenal. It’s millions and millions of newspaper clippings on different subjects. There’s a bit [in ‘Stumpwork’] about toads crossing roads from this little article I found about a special tunnel being built, so that toads could traverse the street without being run over.” NB: “When we were trying to figure out a name for the record, it felt like the best option. We loved it, and it was really succinct. We liked that the word ‘work’ was in the title.” “No Decent Shoes for Rain” TD: “This was two of those jams from the basement of 4AD. We were quite unsure about this song. We took it to show John at the pre-production rehearsals, and he really liked it, and he didn’t really have anything to say about it, which is quite unusual. A lot of people ask, ‘Why did you record with John again?’ And it’s things like that—because he notices things that are good about you that you don’t notice. I was really self-conscious that the end section sounded too trad, classic rock. It sounded like the safest bit of guitar I’ve ever written. But once he said he was into it, I started to look at it from a different way, and it grew from that.” “Don’t Press Me” FS: “This has some recorder on it, which I had to play at half-time because it was really fast. I was like, ‘Oh, this would be nice if it had this little bit of a recorder on.’ I tried to play it, and I was completely incapable. I’d thought, ‘Oh, I’ll be able to do this. Kids play the recorder all the time. It’s easy.’ Even at half-time, I had to have loads of goes at it. So, it’s me playing the recorder, sped up, because I have no skills.” “Conservative Hell” NB: “I think this song’s really important because through the course of the record there’s two different types of song. There’s these upbeat, jangle, poppy ones and then there’s slightly slower, more groovy ones. This song has two very distinct elements that we’re really happy with. It’s nice as well to be so overtly political, which is not usually our scene.” FS: “The reason it ended up being such an on-the-nose phrase is I was thinking it would be really nice to write a song that was something like ‘Conservative Hell’. And then, after a while, I was like, ‘That’s pretty good’. I think it almost sounds like a silly headline, but accurate too.” “Liberty Log” FS: “The title comes from thinking about spring rolls. They’re like little logs, aren’t they? Then, later, I was thinking about a stupid monument, something that would be a really dumb statue in a town—just a big log and it’s called the Liberty Log.” LM: “This is one of the ones we took to the studio expecting it to be a shit-ton of editing, structuring and that John would really fuck with it. We jammed it, and it just stayed the same. This one was first-take vibes, playing it in that way, expecting it to be changed.” “Icebergs” NB: “I think this is quite a bleak moment for us. Definitely the most icy-sounding track on the album. It feels like a really good end to the record to suddenly have this explosion of brass come in, and then it just peters out very slowly. I like that the album ends on quite an icy tone, even though that doesn’t necessarily represent us in how we feel about things. It’s a slightly more poignant ending rather than a nice, lovely outro.”",

        "notes" : "The contradiction of Bill Callahan’s 2010s output is how an artist seemingly so stoic and withdrawn could be so completely in love with everyday life. His performances get more nuanced and his metaphorical power richer every album, whether it’s the image of his infant daughter suspended angelically above the ground because everyone wants to carry her around (“First Bird”), or the way a horse inside a house reminds him of the way we have to ”bow our heads to get in and out of what we’re living in”—a mix of American surrealism and Buddhist humility he can safely call his own. And for a singer who once said that the only time he felt part of the world is when he was alone in his room (Smog’s “Ex-Con”), now he can’t wait to get out with the stroller for another trip around the neighbourhood (“Natural Information”) with a horn section and backup singers in tow. Peace, love and fun—and evidently hard-won.",

        "notes" : "If The Smile ever seemed like a surprisingly upbeat name for a band containing two members of Radiohead (Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, joined by Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner), the trio used their debut gig to offer some clarification. Performing as part of Glastonbury Festival’s Live at Worthy Farm livestream in May 2021, Yorke announced, “We are called The Smile: not The Smile as in ‘Aaah!’—more the smile of the guy who lies to you every day.” To grasp the mood of their debut album, it’s instructive to go even deeper into a name that borrows the title of a 1970 Ted Hughes poem. In Hughes’ impressionist verse, some elemental force—compassion, humanity, love maybe—rises up to resist the deception and chicanery behind such disarming grins. And as much as the 13 songs on A Light for Attracting Attention sense crisis and dystopia looming, they also crackle with hope and insurrection. The pulsing electronics of opener “The Same” suggest the racing hearts and throbbing temples of our age of acute anxiety, and Yorke’s words feel like a call for unity and mobilisation: “We don’t need to fight\/Look towards the light\/Grab it in with both hands\/What you know is right.” Perennially contemplating the dynamics of power and thought, he surveys a world where “devastation has come” (“Speech Bubbles”) under the rule of “elected billionaires” (“The Opposite”), but it’s one where protest, however extreme, can still birth change (“The Smoke”). Amid scathing guitars and outbursts of free jazz, his invective zooms in on abuses of power (“You Will Never Work in Television Again”) before shaming inertia and blame-shifters on the scurrying beats and descending melodies of “A Hairdryer”. These aren’t exactly new themes for Yorke and it’s not a record that sits at an extreme outpost of Radiohead’s extended universe. Emboldened by Skinner’s fluid, intrepid rhythms, A Light for Attracting Attention draws frequently on various periods of Yorke and Greenwood’s past work. The emotional eloquence of Greenwood’s soundtrack projects resurfaces on “Speech Bubbles” and “Pana-Vision”, while Yorke’s fascination with digital reveries continues to be explored on “Open the Floodgates” and “The Same”. Elegantly cloaked in strings, “Free in the Knowledge” is a beautiful acoustic-guitar ballad in the lineage of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees” and the original live version of “True Love Waits”. Of course, lesser-trodden ground is visited, too: most intriguingly, math-rock (“Thin Thing”) and folk songs fit for a ’70s sci-fi drama (“Waving a White Flag”). The album closes with “Skrting on the Surface”, a song first aired at a 2009 show Yorke played with Atoms for Peace. With Greenwood’s guitar arpeggios and Yorke’s aching falsetto, it calls back even further to The Bends’ finale, “Street Spirit (Fade Out)”. However, its message about the fragility of existence—“When we realise we have only to die, then we’re out of here\/We’re just skirting on the surface”—remains sharply resonant.",

        "notes" : "“When it’s just us two, it’s really easy to make music,” JD BECK tells Apple Music. “We play around, and the tracks come pouring out.” Instrumental prodigies DOMi & JD BECK certainly have a telepathic connection when it comes to creativity. First meeting in 2018 at the NAMM trade show in Southern California, where the two teenagers were individually invited to perform as part of a larger ensemble, Texas-born drummer BECK formed an instant connection with French keyboardist and Berklee student DOMi Louna (born Domitille Degalle). The pair soon began writing fast-paced, note-packed jams to upload to their Instagram, and by 2020, they had caught the attention of multi-instrumentalist Anderson .Paak. Swiftly signing them to his APESHIT label, he challenged the duo to release an updated body of work as a debut. “He basically told us we could do better than the album’s worth of material we already had,” BECK says. “So, we put together a wish list of collaborators and got to work.” The result is NOT TiGHT, a 15-track jazz-fusion odyssey of head-nodding hip-hop, psychedelic vocoder experiments and rhythmic freakouts. “We just wanted to surprise ourselves with this album,” DOMi says. “This music is an expression of ourselves at our core.” Here, DOMi & JD BECK offer their thoughts on each of the album’s tracks. “LOUNA’S iNTRO” DOMi Louna: “We thought the album needed book-ending to help bring the listener in and then back out of the tracks. We already had the outro, “THANK U”, so we wrote these chords and added synth patches before sending it to violin, double bass, viola, cello and harp players all around the world. It was like a mini online orchestra opening the album for us.” “WHATUP” DL: “We’ve had these chords since 2018, as they were part of a track that was going to be the intro for our original album. We kept playing around with it when we were locked down together during the pandemic, and after deconstructing it a few times, we decided to make a new tune. We added a drum solo section, and so now the record has two intros before we get into ‘SMiLE’.” “SMiLE” JD BECK: “I sing dumb little melodies a lot, and when I was in the bathroom on my phone one day in 2018, the melody just came to me. I put it together in my head and shouted to DOMi to quickly set it to some chords.” “BOWLiNG” (feat. Thundercat) JDB: “We met Thundercat around the same time as meeting each other. Whenever we were in LA, we would go and stay with him and take over his house. We always write a lot with him when we’re there—we must have 50 song ideas together already. Back in 2018, we’d all go bowling a lot, as it’s his favourite thing to do, and so we wrote this song about hanging out in the bowling alley.” “NOT TiGHT” (feat. Thundercat) JDB: “It’s probably the closest representation of our sound—just singing random melodic lines to crazy chord combinations. In 2019, we played it for Thundercat, and he loved it so much that he wanted to be on it. He became the first instrumentalist to collaborate with us, and it was incredible to have him soloing on the track with DOMi.” “TWO SHRiMPS” (feat. Mac DeMarco) DL: “We wrote the instrumental for this track while we were on tour in 2019. JD had a little drum machine, which he made a loop on, and then I added the keyboard parts and put it in a 9\/8 time signature. We met Mac the same day we met Anderson .Paak in 2019, and by 2020, we were spending a lot of time at Mac’s house. We played him this instrumental, and he started singing along to it, just listing random sandwich names. The track was originally called ‘Sandwiches of America’. We ended up re-recording new lyrics with him, but thankfully it’s still food-related.” “U DON’T HAVE TO ROB ME” JDB: “I’ve been playing gigs by myself since I was 11, and I got used to the element of danger, being in cities late at night. When DOMi and I started going out in LA, you could feel when there was danger, like one day we were in the parking lot of the bowling alley at 1 am, and this dude asked us for a cigarette, and it really felt like he might pull a knife on us too. It made us think about how we never have cash—only cards that we can cancel easily—so why even go through that trouble of robbing us?” “MOON” (feat. Herbie Hancock) JDB: “Andy made us write down all our goals for the record, and among them was a list of people we’d love to work with. Herbie was at the top of those names. One of Andy’s managers had a connect with Herbie, and he called us one day to say that Herbie had watched our videos on YouTube and was down to collaborate.” DL: “We were shitting our pants, as we knew we now had to come up with the best song we’d ever written. Sunlight is some of our favourite stuff that Herbie has done with the vocoder, and so we wrote ‘MOON’ to that same vibe. Luckily, we got him on piano, too, and when we recorded it together in 2021, we got to hang out with him, which was amazing.” “DUKE” JDB: “This track is a George Duke reference. We had been hanging out a lot with Earl Sweatshirt and his producer Black Noise, and they inspired us to put three of our loops together into one track and then record it as a new song. The record is full of crazy songs, and we needed something to chill after Herbie—a track that has a natural feel.” “TAKE A CHANCE” (feat. Anderson .Paak) DL: “We really wanted a feature from Anderson, as we’re huge fans of his, and so we had to come up with something unique and very pretty for him to sing and play on. JD wrote this hook, and when we played it to Andy, he just started rapping over the verses, and then we all sang on the chorus. The whole track was a bunch of surprises and sections put together, since Andy can fit over pretty much anything.” “SPACE MOUNTAiN” JDB: “When we first got to LA, I couldn’t get into any clubs, so the only thing we ended up doing, apart from making music, was going to Disneyland. We went on the ride Space Mountain a lot, and it felt like the perfect title for this crazy tune. The first section is a loop we wrote in 2019, where I recorded the drums through an intense compressor, and then the second half used to be part of the original intro to our first album.” “PiLOT” (feat. Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes & Snoop Dogg) DL: “We made this beat in 2020, before we signed with Anderson. We used to send him clips of what we were making, and the day after we sent him this, he emailed it back with him and Busta on it, which was amazing. Once we signed, we had Snoop Dogg on our dream list of collabs, and we thought he would be perfect for ‘PiLOT’. He was down for it, so we went to Snoop’s studio for six hours one day and recorded it all super smooth. It was very cool to see him and Andy interact and write to our loop.” “WHOA” (feat. Kurt Rosenwinkel) JDB: “DOMi wrote the first part of this tune when she was 12. It was on a random Sibelius session that she played by accident, and I loved it. I knew we had to do a song with it, and Kurt felt like the perfect fit. We met him through the drummer Louis Cole when we were in New York in 2019. A week after he had the track, he sent it back with him soloing from beginning to end. It was perfect.” “SNiFF” DL: “The original title for this was ‘You Can Sniff My Butt’. JD wrote it in 2018, all in one go in front of me—and it’s one of my favourite things he’s ever made. We played it at every show as a closer and people loved its pace, so it felt like a good idea to close the record with it too. It was one of the earliest songs we came up with together.” “THANK U” JDB: “This used to be a crazy loop in a 13 time signature, which was called ‘Dermatologist’ because DOMi had just learned what that word was. We wrote it in an Airbnb somewhere in 2018 and then, when we came back to it a few years later for this record, we realised it was perfect to send to the mini-orchestra who played on the intro. It rounds out the album really well.”",

        "notes" : "Unique, strong and sexy—that’s how Beyoncé wants you to feel while listening to RENAISSANCE. Crafted during the grips of the pandemic, her seventh solo album is a celebration of freedom and a complete immersion into house and dance that serves as the perfect sound bed for themes of liberation, release, self-assuredness and unfiltered confidence across its 16 tracks. RENAISSANCE is playful and energetic in a way that captures that Friday-night, just-got-paid, anything-can-happen feeling, underscored by reiterated appeals to unyoke yourself from the weight of others’ expectations and revel in the totality of who you are. From the classic four-on-the-floor house moods of the Robin S.- and Big Freedia-sampling lead single “BREAK MY SOUL” to the Afro-tech of the Grace Jones- and Tems-assisted “MOVE” and the funky, rollerskating disco feeling of “CUFF IT”, this is a massive yet elegantly composed buffet of sound, richly packed with anthemic morsels that pull you in. There are soft moments here, too: “I know you can’t help but to be yourself around me,” she coos on “PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA”, the kind of warm, whispers-in-the-ear love song you’d expect to hear at a summer cookout—complete with an intricate interplay between vocals and guitar that gives Beyoncé a chance to showcase some incredible vocal dexterity. “CHURCH GIRL” fuses R&B, gospel and hip-hop to tell a survivor’s story: “I'm finally on the other side\/I finally found the extra smiles\/Swimming through the oceans of tears we cried.” An explicit celebration of Blackness, “COZY” is the mantra of a woman who has nothing to prove to anyone—“Comfortable in my skin\/Cozy with who I am,” ” Beyoncé muses on the chorus. And on “PURE\/HONEY”, Beyoncé immerses herself in ballroom culture, incorporating drag performance chants and a Kevin Aviance sample on the first half that give way to the disco-drenched second half, cementing the song as an immediate dance-floor favourite. It’s the perfect lead-in to the album closer “SUMMER RENAISSANCE”, which propels the dreamy escapist disco of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” even further into the future.",

        "artist" : "Black Country, New Road",
        "id" : "1586070259",
        "notes" : "Traditionally, a band release their debut album and head out for an extended stretch on the road, honing their live chops, twisting their songs into new shapes. But when Black Country, New Road released For the First Time in February 2021, that route was blocked off by the pandemic. Instead, the London-based band set out to tweak and tamper with their experimental post-rock sound for a transformative second album. They might not have been able to travel, but their music could. “By the time the first album came out, those songs had existed for so long that we were very keen to change the way we wrote music,” bassist Tyler Hyde tells Apple Music. The material that makes up their second record, Ants From Up There, soon came to life, the group using the labyrinthine “Basketball Shoes”, which had been around before their debut, as a springboard. “We wanted to explore the themes we’d created on that song,” says Hyde. “It’s essentially three songs within one, all of which relatively cover the emotions and moods that are on the album. It’s hopeful and light, but still looks at some of the darker sides that the first album showed.”\nThe resultant record sees the band hit hypnotic new peaks. Ants From Up There, recorded before the departure of singer Isaac Wood in January 2022, is less reliant on jerky, rhythmic U-turns than their debut (although there is some of that), with expansive, Godspeed You! Black Emperor-ish atmospherics emerging in their place. “Fundamentally, we relearned an entirely new style of playing with each other,” says drummer Charlie Wayne. “We learned a lot about how to express ourselves just for each other rather than for anything else going on externally.” Here Hyde, Wayne and saxophonist Lewis Evans take us through it, track by track.\n“Intro” Lewis Evans: “This uses the theme from ’Basketball Shoes’, compressed into these little micro cells and repeated over and over again. It’s just a straight-up, impactful welcome to the album.”\n“Chaos Space Marine” Tyler Hyde: “In this song, we allowed ourselves to get out all the stupid, funny joke style of playing. It was just our way of saying yes to everything. There are many things across the album—and in previous songs from the last album—that are seemingly good ideas, but they’ve come about through a joke. I think the rest of the album is much more considered than that. It’s our silly song. It’s a voyage. It’s a sea shanty. It’s a space trip.”\n“Concorde” Charlie Wayne: “I love how it follows the same chord progression the whole way through, and it’s driven but very soft. It’s got real moments of delicacy, and it’s a song that we all thought quite a lot about when we were getting it together. When you’re restricted to that one-chord sequence, you want it to feel as though it’s going somewhere and progressing, so the peaks and troughs have to be considered.”\n“Bread Song” LE: “It’s like two different songs in one. You’ve got this really quite flowing and free track in a melodic and conventional harmonic way, but rhythmically free and flowing accompaniment to Isaac’s vocals. It feels quite orchestral, and the way that we all play together on this recording is so in sync with each other. We were listening to each other so much, so the swells that one person starts making, people start responding to, and everybody is swelling at the same time and getting quieter at the same time. Then it turns into this almost Soweto, kind of township-style pop tune at the end. It’s a really fun ending to an intense, emotional tune.”\n“Good Will Hunting” LE: “This is another slightly silly one, and it’s got a really silly ending which actually never made the cut on the album, but it’s heavily driven by the riff on the guitars. I think at the time we were listening to quite a bit of Kurt Vile, especially rhythmically. I can remember a conversation about when we wanted the drums to come in and to be super straight, super driven. Then for the choruses, rhythmically, to completely flip and not feel like they were big at all. So for both the choruses, the drums are just tiny.”\n“Haldern” TH: “We were playing at Haldern Pop Festival in north Germany during lockdown. We’d just been allowed to fly for work purposes, and we were doing this session. We did two performances there, and the second one was a livestream, and we weren’t allowed to play songs that weren’t released. At the time, that left us with not very much that we weren’t already bored with, so we decided to do some improv. It was a very lucky day where we were all very in sync with one another. So ‘Haldern’ was totally from improv, which is not how we write ever.”\n“Mark’s Theme” LE: “This is a tune written kind of for my uncle who passed away from COVID in 2021. I wrote it on my tenor saxophone as soon as I found out. I just started playing and wrote that. It’s a reflection on him and my feelings towards him passing away and everything being really bleak. He was a massive fan and supporter of the band, so it felt right to put that on the album and to have his name remembered with our music.”\n“The Place Where He Inserted the Blade” CW: “For me, this is about as far away as we went from the first album. Aesthetically, where the first album has moments of real dissonance and apathy, ‘The Place Where He Inserted the Blade’ is very warm and rich and quite uplifting. I think it strikes right to the heart of what the album is for me, which is fundamentally being in the room, making music with my friends.”\n“Snow Globes” LE: “This is another tune where we really thought about what we wanted from it before we wrote it. We had examples of things we liked, and one of them was Frank Ocean’s ‘White Ferrari’. We liked the idea of it almost being like two different bands [playing] at the same time. So you’ve got this quite simple but quite heart-wrenching, fugal-sounding arrangement of all the instruments with a drum solo that is just crazy and doesn’t really relate too much to what is going on in the other instruments. We react to the drum solo, but he doesn’t react to us. It’s that kind of idea.”\n“Basketball Shoes” TH: “It’s essentially a medley of the whole album. It’s got literal musical motifs that are repeated on different songs in the album. It touches on all the themes that we’ve been exploring, and it’s the most climactic song on the album. It wouldn’t really make sense to not finish with it, it’s so exhausting. It’s such a journey. I think you just wouldn’t be able to pay much attention to anything that followed it because you’d be so wiped out after listening to it.”",

        "id" : "1632479065",
        "notes" : "Twenty years into their time together as a band—and approaching the 10-year milestone of being a hugely successful one—The 1975 felt in better shape than ever. Self-reflection, sobriety, even fatherhood have influenced the way the four-piece, assisted by producer Jack Antonoff, approached the creation of their fifth studio album, resulting in 11 songs that distil the essence of The 1975 without ever feeling like they’re treading old ground. “The working title, up until I chickened out, was At Their Very Best,” singer\/guitarist Matty Healy tells Apple Music. “But I knew we were coming out in sunglasses and suits, and it could look like a bit of a joke. I’m not joking.” It wouldn’t have been an unfair assumption. Healy has carved out a reputation for building to a punchline—in his lyrics, in conversation, on social media. But he has (mostly) put that defensive reflex aside for this album, dialling back the sardonic interrogations of society which dominated previous records in favour of more soul-baring tracks. “My work has been defined by postmodernism, nihilism, individualism, addiction, need, all that kind of stuff,” says Healy. “As you get a bit older, life starts presenting you with different ideas, such as responsibility? Family? Growing up in general? But they’re less sexy, less transgressive ideas. It would be easy to do another record where I’m being clever and funny. What’s hard to do is just be real and super open.” Being Funny in a Foreign Language is indisputable evidence that those 20 years together and the experience gained has paid off. “This is the first time that we’ve been really good artists and really good producers and grown men at the same time,” Healy says. “It was the right time for this album to not just reaffirm, but almost celebrate who we are. It was a self-analysis and then a reinvention.” Here, he guides us through that reinvention, track by track. “The 1975” “On the first three albums, ‘The 1975’ was a rework of the same piece of music. It came from video games, like how you would turn on a Sega Mega Drive, and it had a check-in, load-up sound. The purpose it serves on this album, apart from being this conceptual thing that we’ve done, is to be like the status update. On our previous albums, the whole record has been about the cultural environment, but here I’m setting that scene up right at the beginning, and then the rest of the album is about me living in this environment and talking about how it makes these bigger ideas of love and home and growing up and things like that really difficult.” “Happiness” “‘Happiness’ is where we acknowledged that there was a certain lyrical and sonic identity to what The 1975 was. We felt like it wouldn’t be a ’75 record if we didn’t have a song that owned what we did best. The thing is, we weren’t actually very ’80s; we just used loads of sounds that grunge and Britpop made unfashionable because they were associated with Phil Collins or whoever, but we were like, ‘No, that sounds better than that.’ It’s a live record, so there’s a lot of call-and-response, a lot of repetition, because we were in the room, jamming.” “Looking for Somebody (To Love)” “If I’m going to talk about guns, it’s probably good for me to talk about the thing that I probably understand or empathise with the most, which is that the only vocabulary or lexicon that we provide for young boys to assert their dominance in any position is one of such violence and destruction. There’s a line that says, ‘You’ve got to show me how to push\/If you don’t want a shove,’ which is me saying we have to try and figure this crisis out because there are so many young men that don’t really have guidance, and a toxic masculinity is inevitable if we don’t address the way we communicate with them.” “Part of the Band” “I really just trusted my instinct. As a narrative, I don’t know what the song is about. It was just this belief that I could talk, and that was OK, and it made sense, and I didn’t have to qualify it that much. I have a friend who is much more articulate than me, and there’s been so many times that he’s explained my lyrics back to me better than I ever could. So, I’ve learned I can sit there and spend five hours articulating what I mean, but I don’t think I need to. A movie doesn’t start by explaining what’s going to happen; it opens on a conversation, and you get what’s going on straight away. So, there’s a level of abstraction in this song where I’m giving the audience the benefit of the doubt.” “Oh Caroline” “The chorus of this song came first—‘Oh Caroline\/I wanna get it right this time\/’Cos you’re always on my mind’—and it just felt really, really universal. I was like, ‘OK, this doesn’t have to be about me. It doesn’t have to be “I was in Manchester in my skinny jeans.”’ You don’t need to have lived a story to write one. Caroline is whoever you want it to be—you can change that name in your head. Sometimes we call songs like this ‘“song” songs’ because they can be covered by other people and still make sense. Well, ‘“getting cucked,” I don’t need it’ would be a weird line for someone, but it’s close enough.” “I’m in Love With You” “I was trying to make it like a traditional 1975 song. I wanted to debase the sincerity. But [guitarist, Adam] Hann and George [Daniel, drummer] really challenged me on it, so I was like, ‘OK, fuck it. I’ll just write a song about being in love.’ At the time, I was in a relationship with a Black girl who was so beautiful, and I was in love with, and there were all these things that came up—especially with the political climate over the last two years—that you can only really learn from experience and living together. Like, our bathroom was full of specific products for skincare and stuff like that. Things you can’t just get at [UK high-street drugstore] Boots. So, there’s the line that goes ‘You show me your Black girl thing\/Pretending that I know what it is (I wasn’t listening),’ which came from this moment when she was talking about something that I had no cultural understanding of, and all I was thinking was, ‘I’m in love with you.’ And maybe I should have been focusing on what it was, but in that moment, I didn’t care about anything cultural or political. I just loved her.” “All I Need to Hear” “Thinking objectively as a songwriter, ‘All I Need to Hear’ is maybe one of my best songs. I was in a big Paul Simon phase, and I was kind of trying to do something similar to what he did on ‘Still Crazy [After All These Years]’. He can be as verbose as me, but that song was really, really tight. Almost lullaby-esque. I wanted to write something that was earnest and sincere and didn’t require me, specifically, to deliver it. I almost hope it will be covered by someone else, and that will become the definitive version.” “Wintering” “This is very much a vignette, a little story in the middle that paints a picture but doesn’t really tell you much of where I’m at. It’s kind of about my family, and it’s kind of a Christmas song, but it’s also that thing of relatable specificity because everyone knows that feeling of getting home for Christmas and the wanting to, but the not wanting to, but the needing to, and having to do all the driving and that whole thing. Other parts of the record have a bit more purpose, even though they’re slightly more abstract, but ‘Wintering’ is just this moment of brevity, and I think it’s really nice.” “Human Too” “There’s lines on the record where I talk about being cancelled and acknowledge that it was something that I was dealing with. There’s no insane smear campaign. No one is going to the trouble of ruining my life for a hobby like they do with Meghan Markle. But it does sting when it happens, and this is the first time I’m saying, ‘It does affect me a bit. I totally get it, I’m a messy person...but I’m a good person. Give me a break a bit.’ I was worried about this song because I didn’t want to sound self-pitying, but it works because it’s really just about empathy and giving each other the benefit of the doubt as humans. We’re all people—let’s not pretend that we’re not going to make mistakes.” “About You” “Warren Ellis from Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds came in to do the arrangement for this song. It was really simple—it sounded like ‘With or Without You’ essentially—and he made it all weird and shoegazey. Even though it’s major key, he gave it this terror, which makes my performance in it a lot less romantic because everything is mushing together, and it’s violent. I think this has a similar vibe to ‘Inside Your Mind’ from the third album. I’ve always loved those kinds of [David] Cronenberg, body-horror analogies, the tension between death and sex. I think that the morose can be quite sensual, and there’s quite a bit of that in my work.” “When We Are Together” “The album was finished with. ‘About You’ was Track 11 and there was a Track 10 called ‘This Feeling’. But because of what the song was about, and also sonic reasons, I was like, ‘That song can’t be on the album.’ But we had to deliver it in four days. So, I said if I could get to New York tomorrow, and Jack [Antonoff] was around, with a drum kit and a bass, I had a half-finished acoustic song that would be better for the record. It needed to finish, and at that moment, it didn’t—there was no emotional resolve. So, I went out there, a bit heartbroken post-breakup, and this was written, recorded and mixed in 30 hours, which is the perfect example of what making this album was like. There’s always been this ‘will they\/won’t they?’ question with The 1975. Are they going to split up? Will Matty go mental? That sort of thing. Totally created by me. But I’ve stopped doing that, and I think of it more as instalments of your favourite thing. Or like seasons from a TV show. ‘When We Are Together’ is the end of this season.”",

        "notes" : "Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith have been through a lot together in their 40-plus years as collaborators. They’ve toured the world countless times in Tears for Fears, the New Wave group they founded in 1981; bounced back from a breakup in the ’90s; and released their sixth album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, as well as a smattering of singles, in the 2000s. Their 1982 breakout single “Mad World”, “Head Over Heels”, “Shout” and “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” remain timeless favourites for generations of listeners, and several chart-topping artists, from The Weeknd to Kanye West and Drake, have sampled their hits to elevate their own. With The Tipping Point, their seventh studio album and first LP in 18 years, they’re immensely satisfied with what they’ve written together—partly because they took their time to write their way back to each other, and largely because they did so on their own terms. “We spent a lot of time doing all these writing sessions over a bunch of years with a lot of what are considered more modern songwriters, and it didn't really work out for us because we felt it was slightly dishonest,” Smith tells Apple Music. “We were left with a lot of things that seemed like attempts at making a modern hit single, and I don't think that's what we do. We're really an album band. We made The Hurting before 'Mad World' was released. We made Songs From the Big Chair before 'Everybody' and 'Shout' were released. We sat down, just the two of us, with two acoustic guitars, and tried to forge a path forward. It felt more honest, and the material at the end of it was far better, probably because it was more honest.” “No Small Thing”, The Tipping Point's first track, is a folk-tinged ballad that builds into a sweeping epic, and it's one Smith points to as an example of what they hoped to achieve when they reconnected and started writing: “This song is definitely a journey, and albums for us should be a journey.”",

        "notes" : "In the context of Nilüfer Yanya’s second album, the word “painless” has a few different meanings. “I was enjoying the process of making the record, and thinking, ‘Why do you have to beat yourself up in order to make something?’” the London singer\/guitarist tells Apple Music. “Obviously, you have to work hard, but often the idea of really struggling is something that people inflict on others, just because it's the idea they sell to them, like, ‘Oh, you need to go through this.’” Yanya felt that she hadn't given herself enough time and space to make her 2019 debut, Miss Universe—a record based loosely, and playfully, around the concept of self-help and wellness, and what happens when you get too in your head about things. So, in the thick of the pandemic, she eased into making PAINLESS, writing the songs more collaboratively—mostly with producer Will Archer—than she had been used to. “I kind of felt a bit like, ‘Am I cheating?’ Because you're sharing the work, it feels lighter,” she says. \"But then because of that, I kind of delved in deeper and it got a bit darker.” (The album title actually comes from the “shameless” lyric “Until you fall, it's painless.”) Those depths can be felt both in Yanya's vocal dynamics and the sense of urgency that underpins much of the album, particularly on opener “the dealer” and “stabilise”, the first single. “I think the rhythm plays a big part in these songs,” Yanya says. “You feel like there needs to be an escape somewhere.” Here Yanya talks through PAINLESS, track by track. “the dealer” “It's like when someone's hiding behind their layers, or not being honest, but then also you're not being honest with yourself. My favourite lyric is 'I hope it's just the summertime you grew attached to,' because it's like you're lying to yourself. You’re not saying, 'Oh, it was this person that made the difference, or it was this person that I miss.' You're just saying, 'I had a great time,' and you're not being honest about why.” “L\/R” “[Producer] Bullion played me this beat, and it had this pitched drum in it. It just made me feel really happy and warm. It had this kind of marching feeling to it, which I really liked. It took us like a year to finish it, but the initial idea came really quickly. I like the almost spoken element to it, because it sounds like you're speaking rather than singing, but then the chorus is very much singing—and it took a while to get that right. It's kind of about so many things. In my notebook at the time, I'd written, 'Do less things'—like, less is more. That was my thinking behind the song: trying to enjoy simple things and not overcomplicate things.” “shameless” “It's a really intimate song. I felt like it was about someone that's trying to run away from stuff in their life, but they kind of don't have much hope. The vocals are very celestial—not something I really experimented with in the past. At first, I was going to kind of speak the words, but it needed a lighter touch, like something even more delicate.” “stabilise” “That was the first one me and Will did together. All the others kind of grew off that song. It's about environments and the way they impact you, and not being able to escape your environment, taking it with you wherever you go. And it kind of becomes your cage or the way you view things. You know when you've been somewhere too long and then it's hard to imagine the world another way? Definitely a very lockdown song.” “chase me” “I really liked the line 'Through corridors your love will chase me,' because it was like the safe feeling you can get when you know you are loved, but you don't necessarily want it. It's almost like an ego song for me. It's very confident.” “midnight sun” “I was digging into more of an overall feeling and a mood. I feel like it's a song about confidence and finding your own voice in order to speak up, whether that's about your own feelings or bigger issues: ‘I can't keep my mouth shut this time. I can't keep my head down. I'm not going along with this anymore.’” “trouble” “That song is so sad—in a beautiful way, if I may say so. It also felt like quite a brave one for me because it's very different. When I was writing, I was like, 'Am I doing a straight-up pop song?' It's not. I think it definitely has that take on it. The vocals needed to be more intimate. Like one voice, and it just all keeps spilling out. It's quite challenging to sing. ‘Trouble’ is one of those words—I think I heard it in a Cat Stevens song—'Trouble, set me free'—and I really loved the way it was being referred to almost like a person. In the lyrics here, it's something that's quite persistent and it's not going away. Something's definitely broken that you can't fix.” “try” “This one is about getting better, and feeling the need to connect on a deeper level, finding new depths and making new connections, but becoming confused, tired and dejected with the effort it takes.” “company” “It's about giving up and you're not in a happy place. Originally it started out as, like, you're in a relationship that you are just really not sure about and you're trying to give signs across that you're trying to get rid of someone. But I think the song now is definitely about your inner demons, and they're not really going away.” “belong with you” “I did this with Jazzi Bobbi, who's in my band. She does more electronic stuff, so that definitely comes into play. I feel like builds are always my favourite things in songs, and at the beginning we actually tried to overcomplicate the song and there was like a whole other section and it changed tempo and it just wasn't working. And I was like, 'We just need to keep building and that's it.' What it's about is like you're tied into something, but you know you're too good for it or you want to leave. I feel like these are all the songs, in a way. It’s like, escape—but you can't escape.” “the mystic” “It's about watching other people get on with their lives and feeling like you're being left behind. I spend a lot of time doing music, so that's where I put all my energy, and I was like, 'Oh, I thought we were all still doing that.' Other people have got other plans and you're like, 'Oh, you're a grown-up. You're going to move in with your boyfriend,' or, 'Oh, you can drive now.' The verse is really sad, because it's about watching that happen, and feeling very insecure and unconfident.” “anotherlife” “For me, this has a completely different energy. It's kind of like you're admitting you're lost now, but in a parallel universe or in the future, you won't always be lost. It's not always bad to be in that kind of lost, super-emotional, flung-out state. I find sometimes when something bad happens and you get really upset, it's kind of— I don't want to say cleansing, but you see things with this new kind of brilliance and clarity. And that's kind of a beautiful moment.”In the context of Nilüfer Yanya’s second album, the word “painless” has a few different meanings. “I was enjoying the process of making the record, and thinking, ‘Why do you have to beat yourself up in order to make something?’” the London singer\/guitarist tells Apple Music. “Obviously, you have to work hard, but often the idea of really struggling is something that people inflict on others, just because it's the idea they sell to them, like, ‘Oh, you need to go through this.’” Yanya felt that she hadn't given herself enough time and space to make her 2019 debut, Miss Universe—a record based loosely, and playfully, around the concept of self-help and wellness, and what happens when you get too in your head about things.

It's kind of like you're admitting you're lost now, but in a parallel universe or in the future, you won't always be lost. It's not always bad to be in that kind of lost, super-emotional, flung-out state. I find sometimes when something bad happens and you get really upset, it's kind of— I don't want to say cleansing, but you see things with this new kind of brilliance and clarity. And that's kind of a beautiful moment.”",

We’ll be there to hold your hand and guide you through this painless transition. But what’s the rush? Just relax and enjoy another hour of commercial ‘free yourself’ music on 103.5 Dawn FM. Tune in.” \nThe Weeknd's previous album After Hours was released right as the world was falling into the throes of the pandemic; after scrapping material that he felt was wallowing in the depression he was feeling at the time, Dawn FM arrives as a by-product of—and answer to—that turmoil. Here, he replaces woeful introspection with a bit of upbeat fantasy—the result of creatively searching for a way out of the claustrophobic reality of the previous two years. With the experience of hosting and curating music for his very own MEMENTO MORI radio show on Apple Music as his guiding light, Dawn FM is crafted in a similar fashion, complete with a DJ to set the tone for the segments within. “It’s time to walk into the light and accept your fate with open arms,” the host, voiced by Jim Carrey, declares on the opening track. “Scared? Don't worry.” \nIndeed, there is nothing to fear. The Weeknd packs the first half with euphoric bursts that include the Swedish House Mafia-assisted “How Do I Make You Love Me?” and “Sacrifice”. On the back half, he moves into the more serene waters of “Is There Someone Else?” and “Starry Eyes”. Despite the somewhat morose album cover, which reflects what many feel like as they wade through the seemingly endless purgatory of a life dictated by a virus, he’s aiming for something akin to hope in all of this gloom.",

But Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul effortlessly combine lean, punchy electro-pop with an unapologetically sarcastic sense of humour. On the Belgian duo’s debut album, Topical Dancer, the two musicians draw on their multicultural backgrounds to take sly potshots at racism, sexism and self-doubt. On “Esperanto”, Adigéry riffs on microaggressions over plunging electric bass, and on “Blenda”, she marries a crisp, funky groove with a surprisingly vulnerable chorus: “Go back to your country where you belong\/Siri, can you tell me where I belong?” Co-produced by their long-time collaborators Soulwax, the album slices neatly across the overlap between punky disco, indie dance and underground house; ’80s avant-pop influences (Art of Noise, Talking Heads) brush up against the sing-speaking wit of contemporaries like Marie Davidson and Dry Cleaning. Some of the album’s most powerful moments transcend language entirely: On “Haha”, Adigéry’s laughter is chopped up and dribbled over an EBM-inspired beat, making for a slow-motion floor-filler that’s as surreal as it is captivating.",

        "notes" : "Panda Bear’s music has always felt connected to the innocence and melancholy of ’60s pop, but Reset is the first time he’s made the connection so explicit. Built on simple loops of often familiar songs (The Drifters’ “Save the Last Dance for Me”, The Everly Brothers’ “Love of My Life”), the music here is both an homage to a bygone style and a rendering of how that style could play out in a modern context—in other words, time travel. Together with Sonic Boom—formerly of Spacemen 3 and himself an expert interpreter of ’60s pop and psychedelia—he gives you his handclaps (“Everyday”) and heartaches (“Danger”) and windswept sha-las (“Edge of the Edge”). But they also summon the fatalism that made artists like The Shangri-Las so bewitching (“Go On”) and the space-age wonder that characterised producers like Joe Meek and the early electronic musician Raymond Scott (“Everything’s Been Leading to This”). And like the supposedly basic teenage sounds it came from, Reset’s smile conceals a yearning and complexity that runs deep.",

        "notes" : "Harry Styles’ third solo album, Harry’s House, is the product of a chain reaction. Had the pandemic not thrown his world into a tailspin in early 2020, he would’ve continued to tour behind Fine Line, his critically adored sophomore album, and played its songs hundreds of times for sold-out crowds around the world. A return to the studio was planned, of course, but when COVID-19 cancelled those plans too, Styles faced an empty calendar for the first time in a decade. The singer opted to use this free time carefully, taking a solo road trip through Italy and visiting with family and friends for rare long, drawn-out stretches. It was an important moment of re-evaluation. “You miss so many birthdays,” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And eventually it's just assumed you're unable to be at stuff. Finally I was like, ‘I want to balance my life out a bit. Working isn’t who I am, it's something I do. I want to be able to put that down.’” His upbeat, lightly electronic third LP riffs on the concept of home, viewing it less as a geographical location and more as a state of mind—his mind. “Imagine it’s a day in my house, a day in my mind,” he said. “What do I go through? I’m playing fun music. I’m playing sad music. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff.” Because of the pandemic, Styles recorded the songs with a small handful of long-time friends and close collaborators who gathered in a single room to drink wine, write and play. That intimacy is reflected in the songs, which are conversational and casually confessional, as if he’s thinking out loud. Blending vintage folk rock with flickers of disco and a generally more relaxed sensibility, they illustrate a turning point in Styles’ career as he transitions even further towards career singer-songwriter. “For a while it was, how do I play that game of remaining exciting?” he says. “But I finally had a moment where I felt like, ‘Okay, I’m not the young thing, so I would like to really think about who I want to be as a musician.’” Read on for the inside story behind a handful of standout selections from Harry’s House. “Music for a Sushi Restaurant” “After Fine Line, I had an idea of how I thought the next album would open. But there's something about ‘Sushi’ that felt like, ‘Nah, that's how I want to start.’ It becomes really obvious what the first song should be based on what you play for people when they’re like, ‘Oh, can I hear a bit of the music?’ It's like, how do you want to set the tone?” “Daylight” “We were like, ‘We have to find a way to stay awake and finish this, because if we all go to bed, then this won’t turn out the way it would if we finished tonight.’ So we powered through, finished it and went down to the beach as the sun was coming up and it was like, ‘Okay. Yeah.’ It felt correct that we'd finished it in that place. Life, and songs in particular, are so much about moments. In surfing, for example, sometimes you don't get the wave and sometimes the wave comes and you haven't practised. But every now and again, the wave comes and you’re ready, you've practised enough that you can ride it. Sometimes when the songs write themselves like that, it feels like, ‘Okay, there's a reason why sometimes I sit out there, falling off the board a bunch. It's for this moment.” “As It Was” “‘As It Was’, to me, is bittersweet. It’s devastating. It's a death march. It’s about metamorphosis and a perspective change, which are not necessarily things you have time with. People aren’t like, ‘Oh, we'll give you a couple more days with this moment and let you say goodbye to your former self,’ or whatever. No. Everyone is changing, and by the time you realise what’s happened, [the moment] is already gone. During the pandemic, I think we all at some point realised that it would never be the same as it was before. It was so obvious that it wouldn’t. You can't go backwards—we can’t as a society and I can’t in my personal life. But you learn so much in those moments because you’re forced to face things head-on, whether they’re your least favourite things about the world or your least favourite things about yourself, or all of it.” “Matilda” “I had an experience with someone where, in getting to know them better, they revealed some stuff to me that was very much like, ‘Oh, that's not normal, like I think you should maybe get some help or something.’ This song was inspired by that experience and person, who I kind of disguised as Matilda from the Roald Dahl book. I played it to a couple of friends and all of them cried. So I was like, ‘Okay, I think this is something to pay attention to.’ It's a weird one, because with something like this, it's like, ‘I want to give you something, I want to support you in some way, but it's not necessarily my place to make it about me because it's not my experience.’ Sometimes it's just about listening. I hope that's what I did here. If nothing else, it just says, ‘I was listening to you.’” “Boyfriends” “‘Boyfriends’ was written right at the end of Fine Line. I'd finished the album and there was an extra week where I wrote ‘Adore You’, ‘Lights Up’ and ‘Treat People With Kindness’. At the end of the session for ‘Lights Up’, we started writing ‘Boyfriends’ and it felt like, ‘Okay, there's a version of this story where we get this song ready for this album.’ But something about it just felt like, no, it’ll have its time, let's not rush it. We did so many versions of it. Vocal. Acoustic. Electric guitar. Harmonies on everything, and then we took them out for chunks and put them back in for chunks. You try not to get ahead of yourself when you write a song, but there was something about this one where I felt like, ‘Okay, when I'm 50, if I'm playing a show, maybe there's someone who heard me for the first time when they were 15 and this is probably the song they came to see.’ Because I'm learning so much by singing it. It’s my way of saying, ‘I’m hearing you.’ It’s both acknowledging my own behaviour and looking at behaviour I've witnessed. I grew up with a sister, so I watched her date people, and I watched friends date people, and people don't treat each other very nicely sometimes.” “Cinema” “I think I just wanted to make something that felt really fun, honestly. I was on a treadmill going, ‘Do-do-do-do-do-do.’ I tend to do so much writing in the studio, but with this one, I did a little bit here and then I went home and added a little bit there, and then kind of left it, and then went into the studio to put it all together. That was a theme across the whole album, actually: We used to book a studio and be like, ‘Okay, we've got it for two months, grind it out.’ But some days you just don't want to be there, and eventually you've been in the studio so long, the only thing you can write about is nothing because you haven't done anything. So with this album, we’d work for a couple of weeks and then everyone would go off and live their lives.” “Love of My Life” “‘Love of My Life’ was the most terrifying song because it's so bare. It's so sparse. It’s also very much in the spirit of what Harry's House is about: I wanted to make an acoustic EP, all in my house, and make it really intimate. It’s named after [the Japanese pop pioneer Haruomi] Hosono, who had an album in the '70s called Hosono House. I immediately started thinking about what Harry’s House might look like. It took time for me to realise that the house wasn't a geographical location, it was an internal thing. When I applied that concept to the songs we were making here, everything took on new meaning. Imagine it's a day in my house or a day in my mind. What do I go through? I'm playing fun music. I'm playing sad music. I'm playing this, I'm playing that. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff. And it’s all mine. This is my favourite album at the moment. I love it so much. And because of the circumstances, it was made very intimately; everything was played by a small number of people and made in a room. To me, it's everything. It's everything I've wanted to make.”",

        "notes" : "In sharply differing ways, thoughts of place and identity run through Fontaines D.C.’s music. Where 2019 debut Dogrel delivered a rich and raw portrait of the band’s home city, Dublin, 2020 follow-up A Hero’s Death was the sound of dislocation, a set of songs drawing on the introspection, exhaustion and yearning of an anchorless life on the road. When the five-piece moved to London midway through the pandemic, the experiences of being outsiders in a new city, often facing xenophobia and prejudice, provided creative fuel for third album Skinty Fia. The music that emerged weaves folk, electronic and melodic indie pop into their post-punk foundations, while contemplating Irishness and how it transforms in a different country. “That’s the lens through which all of the subjects that we explore are seen through anyway,” singer Grian Chatten tells Apple Music’s Matt Wilkinson. “There are definitely themes of jealousy, corruption and stuff like that, but it’s all seen through the eyes of someone who’s at odds with their own identity, culturally speaking.” Recording the album after dark helped breed feelings of discomfort that Chatten says are “necessary to us”, and it continued a nocturnal schedule that had originally countered the claustrophobia of a locked-down city. “We wrote a lot of it at night as well,” says Chatten. “We went into the rehearsal space just as something different to do. When pubs and all that kind of thing were closed, it was a way of us feeling like the world was sort of open.” Here, Chatten and guitarist Carlos O’Connell talk us through a number of Skinty Fia’s key moments. “In ár gCroíthe go deo” Grian Chatten: “An Irish woman who lived in Coventry [Margaret Keane] passed away. Her family wanted the words ‘In ár gCroíthe go deo’, which means ‘in our hearts forever’, on her gravestone as a respectful and beautiful ode to her Irishness, but they weren’t allowed without an English translation. Essentially the Church of England decreed that it would be potentially seen as a political slogan. The Irish language is apparently, according to these people, an inflammatory thing in and of itself, which is a very base level of xenophobia. It’s a basic expression of a culture, is the language. If you’re considering that to be related to terrorism, which is what they’re implying, I think. That sounds like it’s something out of the ’70s, but this is two and a half years ago.” Carlos O’Connell: “About a year ago, it got turned around and [the family] won this case.” GC: “The family were made aware [of the song] and asked if they could listen to it. Apparently they really loved it, and they played it at the gravestone. So, that’s 100,000 Grammys worth of validation.” “Big Shot” CO: “When you’ve got used to living with what you have and then all these dreams happen to you, it’s always going to overshadow what you had before. The only impact that [Fontaines’ success] was having in my life was that it just made anything that I had before quite meaningless for a while, and I felt quite lost in that. That’s that lyric, ‘I travelled to space and found the moon too small’—it’s like, go up there and actually it’s smaller than the Earth.” GC: “We’ve all experienced it very differently and that’s made us grow in different ways. But that song just sounded like a very true expression of Carlos. Perhaps more honest than he always is with himself or other people. All the honesty was balled up into that tune.” “Jackie Down the Line” GC: “It’s an expression of misanthropy. And there’s toxicity there. There’s erosion of each other’s characters. It’s a very un-beneficial, unglamorous relationship that isn’t necessarily about two people. I like the idea of it being about Irishness, fighting to not be eroded as it exists in a different country. The name is Jackie because a Dubliner would be called, in a pejorative sense, a Jackeen by people from other parts of Ireland. That’s probably in reference to the Union Jack as well—it’s like the Pale [an area of Ireland, including Dublin, that was under English governmental control during the late Middle Ages]. So it’s this kind of mutation of Irishness or loss of Irishness as it exists, or fails to exist, in a different environment.” “Roman Holiday” GC: “The whole thing was coloured by my experience in London. I moved to London to be with my fiancée, and as an Irish person living in London, as one of a gang of Irish people, there was that kind of searching energy, there was this excitement, there was a kind of adventure—but also this very, very tight-knit, rigorously upkept group energy. I think that’s what influenced the tune.” “The Couple Across the Way” GC: “I lived on Caledonian Road [in North London] and our gaff backed onto another house. There was a couple that lived there, they were probably mid-seventies, and they had really loud arguments. The kind of arguments where you’d see London on a map getting further, further away and hear the shout resounding. Something like The Simpsons. And the man would come out and take a big breath. He’d stand on his balcony and look left and right and exhale all the drama. And then he’d just turn around and go back in to his gaff to do the same thing the next day. The absurdity of that, of what we put ourselves through, to be in a relationship that causes you such daily pain, to just always turn around and go back in. I couldn’t really help but write about that physical mirror that was there. Am I seeing myself and my girlfriend in these two people, and vice versa? So I tried to tie it in to it being from both perspectives at some point.” “Skinty Fia” GC: “The line ‘There is a track beneath the wheel and it’s there ’til we die’ is about being your dad’s son. There are many ways in which we explore doom on this record. One of them is following in the footsteps of your ancestors, or your predecessors, no matter how immediate or far away they might have been. I’m interested in the inescapability of genetics, the idea that your fate is written. I do, on some level, believe in that. That is doom, even if your faith is leading you to a positive place. Freedom is probably the main pursuit of a lot of our music. I think that that is probably a link that ties all of the stuff that we’ve done together—autonomy.” “I Love You” GC: “It’s most ostensibly a love letter to Ireland, but has in it the corruption and the sadness and the grief with the ever-changing Dublin and Ireland. The reason that I wanted to call it ‘I Love You’ is because I found its cliché very attractive. It meant that there was a lot of work to be done in order to justify such a basic song and not have it be a clichéd tune. It’s a song with two heads, because you’ve got the slow, melodic verses that are a little bit more straightforward and then the lid is lifted off energetically. I think that the friction between those two things encapsulates the double-edged sword that is love.” “Nabokov” GC: “I think there’s a different arc to this album. The first two, I think, achieve a sense of happiness and hope halfway through, and end on a note of hope. I think this one does actually achieve hope halfway through—and then slides back into a hellish, doomy thing with the last track and stuff. I think that was probably one of the more conscious decisions that we made while making this album.”",

        "notes" : "“I literally don’t take breaks,” ROSALÍA tells Apple Music. “I feel like, to work at a certain level, to get a certain result, you really need to sacrifice.” Judging by MOTOMAMI, her long-anticipated follow-up to 2018’s award-winning and critically acclaimed EL MAL QUERER, the mononymous Spanish singer clearly put in the work. “I almost feel like I disappear because I needed to,” she says of maintaining her process in the face of increased popularity and attention. “I needed to focus and put all my energy and get to the centre to create.” At the same time, she found herself drawing energy from bustling locales like Los Angeles, Miami and New York, all of which she credits with influencing the new album. Beyond any particular source of inspiration that may have driven the creation of MOTOMAMI, ROSALÍA’s come-up has been nothing short of inspiring. Her transition from critically acclaimed flamenco upstart to internationally renowned star—marked by creative collaborations with global tastemakers like Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish and Oneohtrix Point Never, to name a few—has prompted an artistic metamorphosis. Her ability to navigate and dominate such a wide array of musical styles only raised expectations for her third full-length, but she resisted the idea of rushing things. “I didn’t want to make an album just because now it’s time to make an album,” she says, citing that several months were spent on mixing and visuals alone. “I don’t work like that”. Some three years after EL MAL QUERER, ROSALÍA’s return feels even more revolutionary than that radical breakout release. From the noisy-yet-referential leftfield reggaetón of “SAOKO” to the austere and Yeezus-reminiscent thump of “CHICKEN TERIYAKI”, MOTOMAMI makes the artist’s femme-forward modus operandi all the more clear. The point of view presented is sharp and political, but also permissive of playfulness and wit, a humanising mix that makes the album her most personal yet. “I was like, I really want to find a way to allow my sense of humour to be present,” she says. “It’s almost like you try to do, like, a self-portrait of a moment of who you are, how you feel, the way you think.\" Things get deeper and more unexpected with the devilish-yet-austere electronic punk funk of the title track and the feverish “BIZCOCHITO”. But there are even more twists and turns within, like “HENTAI”, a bilingual torch song that charms and enraptures before giving way to machine-gun percussion. Add to that “LA FAMA”, her mystifying team-up with The Weeknd that fuses tropical Latin rhythms with avant-garde minimalism, and you end up with one of the most unique artistic statements of the decade so far.",

        "notes" : "Folky, direct soul-pop and balladry made Paolo Nutini famous as a teen during the mid-2000s, but it was his adventurousness that quickly separated him from other British singer-songwriters emerging at that time. When second album Sunny Side Up arrived in 2009, he was drawing on ska, Dixieland jazz, country and doo-wop, before 2014’s Caustic Love played out like an expansive history of soul and R&B. From the off, Last Night in the Bittersweet reveals the Scotsman’s horizons have only broadened during the intervening eight years. “Afterneath” begins the album with feedback, motorik rhythms and Tarantino samples as Nutini’s spoken-word lyrics herald “a deep dive into an open mind”. From there, the songs circle around New Wave (“Petrified in Love”), epic indie rock (“Shine a Light”) and hymnal, muted electronica (“Stranded Words [Interlude]”). At the heart of it all is Nutini’s voice. Precociously expressive and versatile from day one, it’s aged handsomely, sounding more lived-in than ever. Here, he contemplates regret, anxiety, optimism and love as it both blossoms and falters. When the record ends on its most unadorned moment, the gentle folk ballad “Writer”, Nutini sings, “I am your writer who bleeds indecision.” It’s that restless, capricious spirit that continues to make him such an absorbing artist.",

For every Beatles-y melody (“Mission”) or warm, reassuring chorus (“Early Morning Waiting”) there’s the image of a cocked gun (“Runner”) or a mangled voice lurking in the mix like the monster in a fairy-tale forest (“S.D.O.S”). His characters describe adult perspectives with the terror and wonder of children (“No Bitterness”, “Blessing”), and several tracks make awestruck references to God. With every album, he draws closer to the conventions of American indie rock without touching them. And by the time you realise he isn’t just another guy in his bedroom with an acoustic guitar, it’s too late.",

        "notes" : "On “Tick Tock”, the second track on Warm Chris, Aldous Harding asks, “Now that you see me, what you gonna do? Wanted to see me.” The New Zealand singer-songwriter’s lyrics have always been veiled and poetically cryptic—and she’s made a point of not explaining the meaning behind any of it. But her fourth album feels assured and open in a way that makes you wonder whether the question is directed at an audience who’ve been wanting to learn more about this singular artist. There’s a lot to see here, and like a well-directed film, it benefits from multiple replays, with more nuances and hidden meanings uncovered on each listen. Across her four albums, you’ll notice a linear emotional evolution. Speaking to Apple Music in 2019 about her then-new album Designer, she said, “I felt freed up… I could feel a loosening of tension, a different way of expressing my thought processes.” The journey clearly continued. Warm Chris is as intimate and curious as ever, but it’s more grounded, more confident. If the tension was loosening on Designer, here, Harding has grown accustomed to the relaxed space and made herself at home. The album seems to deal primarily with connections and relationships. She reflects on a lost love during opener “Ennui” (“You’ve become my joy, you understand… Come back, come back and leave it in the right place”), hunts for faded excitement on “Fever” (“I still stare at you in the dark\/Looking for that thrill in the nothing\/You know my favourite place is the start”), comically complains on “Passion Babe” (“Well, you know I’m married, and I was bored out of my mind\/Of all the ways to eat a cake, this one surely takes the knife… Passion must play, or passion won’t stay”) and accepts an ending on “Lawn” (“Then if you're not for me, guess I am not for you\/I will enjoy the blue, I’m only confused with you”). On the whole, Warm Chris feels light and folksy, and the music is relatively simple—though not without its surprises. There are brass embellishments here, a psychedelic guitar solo there, even a brief foray into forlorn vintage blues on “Bubbles”. It leaves space for Harding’s voice to remain in the spotlight. Her vocal acrobatics are as strange and versatile as ever—she can shift from breathy, dramatically deep bass to ultra-fine, ultra-high falsetto in moments, sometimes for only a word at a time. She sounds innocent and paper-thin on the gentle “Lawn”, lively—and inflected with an unusual accent—on “Passion Babe”. Her delivery is so pronounced and hyperbolic on the heart-wrenching “She’ll Be Coming Round the Mountain” that it sounds like something out of a musical. And album closer “Leathery Whip” feels inspired by The Velvet Underground, complete with a deep Nico drawl (occasionally flipping to a Kate Bush-style nasal tone), backing harmonies, a jangling tambourine and a cheeky refrain: “Here comes life with his leathery whip.”",

        "notes" : "Mitski wasn’t sure she’d ever make it to her sixth album. After the release of 2018’s standout and star-making record Be the Cowboy, she simply had nothing left to give. “I think I was just tired, and I felt like I needed a break and I couldn't do it anymore,” she tells Apple Music. “I just told everyone on my team that I just needed to stop it for a while. I think everyone could tell I was already at max capacity.” And so, in 2019, she withdrew. But if creating became painful, not doing it at all—eventually—felt even worse. “I was feeling a deep surge of regret because I was like, ‘Oh my god, what did I do?’” she says. “I let go of this career that I had worked so hard to get and I finally got, and I just left it all behind. I might have made the greatest mistake of my life.”\nReleased two years after that self-imposed hiatus, Laurel Hell may mark Mitski’s official return, but she isn’t exactly all in. Darkness descends as she moves back into her own musical world (“Let’s step carefully into the dark\/Once we’re in I’ll remember my way around” are this album’s first words), and it feels like she almost always has one eye on her escape route. Such melancholic tendencies shouldn’t come as a surprise: Mitski Miyawaki is an artist who has always delved deep into her experiences as she attempts to understand them—and help us understand our own. More unexpected, though, is the glittering, ’80s-inspired synth-pop she often embraces, from “The Only Heartbreaker”—whose opening drums throw back to a-ha’s “Take On Me”, and against which Mitski explores being the “bad guy” in a relationship—to the bouncy, cinematic “Should’ve Been Me” and the intense “Love Me More”, on which she cries out for affection, from a lover and from her audience, against racing synths. “I think at first, the songs were more straightforwardly rock or just more straightforwardly sad,” she recalls. “But as the pandemic progressed, [frequent collaborator] Patrick [Hyland] and I just stopped being able to stay in that sort of sad feeling. We really needed something that would make us dance, that would make us feel hopeful. We just couldn’t stand the idea of making another sad, dreary album.”\nThis being a Mitski record, there are of course still moments of insular intensity, from “Everyone” to “Heat Lightning”, a brooding meditation on insomnia. And underneath all that protective pop, this is an album about darkness and endings—of relationships, possibly of her career. And by its finish, Mitski still isn’t promising to stick around. “I guess this is the end, I’ll have to learn to be somebody else,” she says on “I Guess”, before simply fading away on final track “That’s Our Lamp”.",

        "notes" : "When Kendrick Lamar popped up on two tracks from Baby Keem’s The Melodic Blue (“range brothers” and “family ties”), it felt like one of hip-hop’s prophets had descended a mountain to deliver scripture. His verses were stellar, to be sure, but it also just felt like way too much time had passed since we’d heard his voice. He’d helmed 2018’s Black Panther compilation\/soundtrack, but his last proper release was 2017’s DAMN. That kind of scarcity in hip-hop can only serve to deify an artist as beloved as Lamar. But if the Compton MC is broadcasting anything across his fifth proper album Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, it’s that he’s only human. The project is split into two parts, each comprising nine songs, all of which serve to illuminate Lamar’s continually evolving world view. Central to Lamar’s thesis is accountability. The MC has painstakingly itemised his shortcomings, assessing his relationships with money (“United in Grief”), white women (“Worldwide Steppers”), his father (“Father Time”), the limits of his loyalty (“Rich Spirit”), love in the context of heteronormative relationships (“We Cry Together”, “Purple Hearts”), motivation (“Count Me Out”), responsibility (“Crown”), gender (“Auntie Diaries”) and generational trauma (“Mother I Sober”). It’s a dense and heavy listen. But just as sure as Kendrick Lamar is human like the rest of us, he’s also a Pulitzer Prize winner, one of the most thoughtful MCs alive and someone whose honesty across Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers could help us understand why any of us are the way we are.",

        "notes" : "A couple of years before she became known as one half of Wet Leg, Rhian Teasdale left her home on the Isle of Wight, where a long-term relationship had been faltering, to live with friends in London. Every Tuesday, their evening would be interrupted by the sound of people screaming in the property below. “We were so worried the first time we heard it,” Teasdale tells Apple Music. Eventually, their investigations revealed that scream therapy sessions were being held downstairs. “There’s this big scream in the song ‘Ur Mum’,” says Teasdale. “I thought it’d be funny to put this frustration and the failure of this relationship into my own personal scream therapy session.” That mix of humour and emotional candour is typical of Wet Leg. Crafting tightly sprung post-punk and melodic psych-pop and indie rock, Teasdale and bandmate Hester Chambers explore the existential anxieties thrown up by breakups, partying, dating apps and doomscrolling—while also celebrating the fun to be had in supermarkets. “It’s my own experience as a twenty-something girl from the Isle of Wight moving to London,” says Teasdale. The strains of disenchantment and frustration are leavened by droll, acerbic wit (“You’re like a piece of shit, you either sink or float\/So you take her for a ride on your daddy’s boat,” she chides an ex on “Piece of Shit”), and humour has helped counter the dizzying speed of Wet Leg’s ascent. On the strength of debut single “Chaise Longue”, Teasdale and Chambers were instantly cast by many—including Elton John, Iggy Pop and Florence Welch—as one of Britain’s most exciting new bands. But the pair have remained committed to why they formed Wet Leg in the first place. “It’s such a shame when you see bands but they’re habitually in their band—they’re not enjoying it,” says Teasdale. “I don’t want us to ever lose sight of having fun. Having silly songs obviously helps.” Here, she takes us through each of the songs—silly or otherwise—on Wet Leg. “Being in Love” “People always say, ‘Oh, romantic love is everything. It’s what every person should have in this life.’ But actually, it’s not really conducive to getting on with what you want to do in life. I read somewhere that the kind of chemical storm that is produced in your brain, if you look at a scan, it’s similar to someone with OCD. I just wanted to kind of make that comparison.” “Chaise Longue” “It came out of a silly impromptu late-night jam. I was staying over at Hester’s house when we wrote it, and when I stay over, she always makes up the chaise longue for me. It was a song that never really was supposed to see the light of day. So it’s really funny to me that so many people are into it and have connected with it. It’s cool. I was as an assistant stylist [on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Bad Habits’ video]. Online, a newspaper [The New York Times] was doing the top 10 videos out this week, and it was funny to see ‘Chaise Longue’ next to this video I’d been working on. Being on set, you have an idea of the budget that goes into getting all these people together to make this big pop-star video. And then you scroll down and it’s our little video that we spent about £50 on. Hester had a camera and she set up all the shots. Then I edited it using a free trial version of Final Cut.” “Angelica” “The song is set at a party that you no longer want to be at. Other people are feeling the same, but you are all just fervently, aggressively trying to force yourself to have a good time. And actually, it’s not always possible to have good times all the time. Angelica is the name of my oldest friend, so we’ve been to a lot of rubbish parties together. We’ve also been to a lot of good parties together, but I thought it would be fun to put her name in the song and have her running around as the main character.” “I Don’t Wanna Go Out” “It’s kind of similar to ‘Angelica’—it’s that disenchantment of getting fucked up at parties, and you’re gradually edging into your late twenties, early thirties, and you’re still working your shitty waitressing job. I was trying to convince myself that I was working these shitty jobs so that I could do music on the side. But actually, you’re kind of kidding yourself and you’re seeing all of your friends starting to get real jobs and they’re able to buy themselves nice shampoo. You’re trying to distract yourself from not achieving the things that you want to achieve in life by going to these parties. But you can’t keep kidding yourself, and I think it’s that realisation that I’ve tried to inject into the lyrics of this song.” “Wet Dream” “The chorus is ‘Beam me up.’ There’s this Instagram account called beam_me_up_softboi. It’s posts of screenshots of people’s texts and DMs and dating-app goings-on with this term ‘softboi’, which to put it quite simply is someone in the dating scene who’s presenting themselves as super, super in touch with their feelings and really into art and culture. And they use that as currency to try and pick up girls. It’s not just men that are softbois; women can totally be softbois, too. The character in the song is that, basically. It’s got a little bit of my own personal breakup injected into it. This particular person would message me since we’d broken up being like, ‘Oh, I had a dream about you. I dreamt that we were married,’ even though it was definitely over. So I guess that’s why I decided to set it within a dream: It was kind of making fun of this particular message that would keep coming through to me.” “Convincing” “I was really pleased when we came to recording this one, because for the bulk of the album, it is mainly me taking lead vocals, which is fine, but Hester has just the most beautiful voice. I hope she won’t mind me saying, but she kind of struggles to see that herself. So it felt like a big win when she was like, ‘OK, I’m going to do it. I’m going to sing. I’m going to do this song.’ It’s such a cool song and she sounds so great on it.” “Loving You” “I met this guy when I was 20, so I was pretty young. We were together for six or seven years or something, and he was a bit older, and I just fell so hard. I fell so, so hard in love with him. And then it got pretty toxic towards the end, and I guess I was a bit angry at how things had gone. So it’s just a pretty angry song, without dobbing him in too much. I feel better now, though. Don’t worry. It’s all good.” “Ur Mum” “It’s about giving up on a relationship that isn’t serving you anymore, either of you, and being able to put that down and walk away from it. I was living with this guy on the Isle of Wight, living the small-town life. I was trying to move to London or Bristol or Brighton and then I’d move back to be with this person. Eventually, we managed to put the relationship down and I moved in with some friends in London. Every Tuesday, it’d get to 7 pm and you’d hear that massive group scream. We learned that downstairs was home to the Psychedelic Society and eventually realised that it was scream therapy. I thought it’d be funny to put this frustration and the failure of this relationship into my own personal scream therapy session.” “Oh No” “The amount of time and energy that I lose by doomscrolling is not OK. It’s not big and it’s not clever. This song is acknowledging that and also acknowledging this other world that you live in when you’re lost in your phone. When we first wrote this, it was just to fill enough time to play a festival that we’d been booked for when we didn’t have a full half-hour set. It used to be even more repetitive, and the lyrics used to be all the same the whole way through. When it came to recording it, we’re like, ‘We should probably write a few more lyrics,’ because when you’re playing stuff live, I think you can definitely get away with not having actual lyrics.” “Piece of Shit” “When I’m writing the lyrics for all the songs with Wet Leg, I am quite careful to lean towards using quite straightforward, unfussy language and I avoid, at all costs, using similes. But this song is the one song on the album that uses simile—‘like a piece of shit’. Pretty poetic. I think writing this song kind of helped me move on from that [breakup]. It sounds like I’m pretty wound up. But actually, it’s OK now, I feel a lot better.” “Supermarket” “It was written just as we were coming out of lockdown and there was that time where the highlight of your week would be going to the supermarket to do the weekly shop, because that was literally all you could do. I remember queuing for Aldi and feeling like I was queuing for a nightclub.” “Too Late Now” “It’s about arriving in adulthood and things maybe not being how you thought they would be. Getting to a certain age, when it’s time to get a real job, and you’re a bit lost, trying to navigate through this world of dating apps and social media. So much is out of our control in this life, and ‘Too late now, lost track somehow,’ it’s just being like, ‘Everything’s turned to shit right now, but that’s OK because it’s unavoidable.’ It sounds very depressing, but you know sometimes how you can just take comfort in the fact that no matter what you do, you’re going to die anyway, so don’t worry about it too much, because you can’t control everything? I guess there’s a little bit of that in ‘Too Late Now’.”",
